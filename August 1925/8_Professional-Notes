The Future Type
Natal and Military Record, 3 June, 1925.-It is interesting to learn that
the French Ministry of Marine has under consideration the design of a new
type of croiseur de combat of 17,500 tons, to have a speed of 35 knots and
carry eight 12-inch guns in two quadruple turrets. Under the Washington
Agreement cruisers of this size and armament are inadmissible, but France
is at liberty to lay down one capital ship up to the limit of 35,000 tons

to replace the lost La France, and there is nothing to prevent her from
halving this tonnage allowance in two hulls if she chooses. Such a step
might exercise an influence upon international naval design of which it is
impossible to foresee the ultimate consequences. The suggested vessels
would be very similar to our original battle cruisers of the Invincible class,
save that they would be 10 knots faster. No capital ship in the world could
be matched against them for speed, and therefore they would have the
capacity of denying action to the only type of warship which could hope
successfully to engage them by gunfire.
On the other hand, vessels of such a character would entirely and hope-
lessly outclass the 10,000-ton ocean cruisers which the great naval powers
are now building with a rather remarkable unanimity of tactical ideas.
One has only to recall the Battle of Falklands in order to realize what the
difference between the two types would easily be. France has so often
proved the pioneer in naval design that it would be only in keeping with
history were she to set a new fashion in big ships. To say that such a re-
action in displacement would be a violation of first principles is sheer rub-
bish. Big ship is a relative term, and the smaller ship will still remain the
big ship if all the sea powers revert to smaller ships. Growth of size
has been the simple result of competition to possess the most formidable
weapon. The Washington Agreement has succeeded in establishing the
principle of equality in this respect, and in the long pause which is follow-
ing upon this stabilizing of rapid development considerations are coming
into play which were apt to be obscured while the rivalry was in progress.
How far these considerations may carry us before the time arrives for a
general resumption of capital ship construction none will yet venture to
say. But these projected French croiseurs de combat may be regarded as
silhouettes on the wall.
The Position of the Shipbuilding Industry in England
The Shipbuilder, June, 1925.—Shipbuilding and coal mining share the
unenviable position of being the most depressed British industries. Every
week sees more shipyards closed for lack of new orders, and the tale of
closed collieries is added to almost daily. The success of foreign competi-
tion in shipbuilding for what contracts there are in the market has led to
the formation of a joint committee, composed of shipbuilding employers
and representatives of the shipyard trade unions, to inquire into the causes
of the severe depression in shipbuilding. This committee has begun its
work in an atmosphere of goodwill. Any recommendations which such an
authoritative body may make will carry more weight than the views of any
individual, however well informed he may be; but it will not be sufficient for
the committee merely to indicate the causes of the depression or the reasons
for the success of foreign competition. These are well known and beyond
doubt. Unless the committee evolves some really constructive proposals for
reducing the cost of production, its labors will not be of much avail.
Trade depression in this country is due to two causes. The first-the
reduced consumption of commodities resulting from impoverishment due to
the war and to the decimation of populations—can be expected to right
itself in time. The second cause—the success of foreign competitors in
securing our markets—cannot be transitory while the conditions here and
abroad show such a wide disparity. Mr. Lawrence D. Holt, the Liverpool
shipowner, in a recent communication to the press following a visit to the
German shipyards, gave seven reasons why certain yards in Germany are
able to build ships vastly cheaper than British yards without any help from
the state. Mr. Holt's seven points put the case clearly and concisely.

They are: (1) A greatly less rate of salary and wage; (2) the universality
of piece work; (3) longer hours of work; (4) no restriction on the use of
labor-saving machines; (5) no demarcation obstacles between trades; (6)
no redundant labor in the yards; and (7) keener work by management and
labor. To make Mr. Holt's list complete, the excessive burden of taxation
on British industry should be added. Mr. Walter Runciman, M.P., gave
figures in the House of Commons recently in connection with a Tees ship-
yard, which showed that the rate burden per ship built has increased
to £5,300. Neither Germany nor Holland, he stated, was foolish enough to
tax and burden its shipyards in the way we do.
What is to be done to alleviate the position? Sir Alfred Mond's scheme
of subsidies to industry should assist in preventing British shipbuilding
contracts going abroad, and might regain for this country a share of the
foreign contracts which are now being secured by Germany, Holland, and
France. It is attractive at first thought to consider giving employers the
benefit of the unemployment insurance payments which would be saved if
they were able to provide employment for men at present idle. It would
help to prevent the youth of the nation developing slothful habits
and growing up to manhood with no trade or occupation. It would
ensure that some work would be done for the huge amounts paid out weekly,
and for which at present the state receives no return. But would it be a
healthy state of affairs for an international industry like shipbuilding to be
kept alive by subsidies ?
It has been suggested that foreign-built ships constructed for British
owners should be taxed, but how would this help the industry? It would not
assist us to regain the foreign market, and it would not prevent British
owners building ships abroad if sufficient inducement were offered. The
result would be to swell the volume of shipping under foreign flags at the
expense of the British.
The fallacious idea held by many at the termination of the war that,
in order to make the country fit for heroes to live in, shorter hours of
work and higher pay were necessary, might have been all right as a matter
of sentiment and an ideal to be aimed at, but the endeavor to put it into
effect has been disastrous for the nation. It is ludicrous to imagine that
less work, and not more, is required after four-and-a-half years of destruc-
tion and of production for destruction. In the shipbuilding industry the
gulf between Continental and British costs will have to be bridged if the
industry in this country is to survive as anything more than a shadow of
its former self. The cost of production in Great Britain and Ireland will
have to be reduced, but the remedy cannot be found in the shipbuilding
industry alone. Shipbuilding in itself is a constructional industry; and its
raw materials are the finished products of other staple industries. The short
hours and high wages of the coal miners, railway workers, dockers and
other transport workers, have added enormously to the cost of ships. The
conditions of work in the so-called sheltered trades are inequitable as com-
pared with those in the competitive trades, and are not only maintaining
the cost of living at a high standard, but are making it impossible for the
competitive trades to continue to pay the rates of wages ruling at present.
The issue is a broad and national one, and until the trade unions recognize
that this country is dependent on its export trade for existence, that trade
goes to the country which sells at the lowest prices, and that a country de-
pendent on its export trade must produce goods of at least equal value
at equal prices to those of its competitors, there seems little hope of a per-
manent trade revival. How can this country hope to compete successfully
in the international markets when the output of our coal mines is 20 per cent
less per man than it was in 1913, when our railways employed 100,000 more

men than in pre-war days and handle about 25,000,000 tons less traffic in the
year, and when it takes three dockers to do the work two men did before
the war?
The position will have to be faced. It is not too much to say, as Sir
Alfred Yarrow is reported to have stated recently that trade-union re-
strictions are paralyzing industry. If, therefore, the joint committee of
employers and trade unions in the shipbuilding industry can, by the example
of its own industry, indicate to the miners, the railwaymen and the dockers
in which direction the true interests of the workers lie, it will have justified
its existence.
FRANCE
French Navy Notes
The Naval and Military Record, 3 June, 1925.—The Dumesnil squadron,
comprising five 24,000-ton battleships, two cruisers, and two dozen torpedo
craft, will next week leave Toulon for a two months' cruise in the Mediter-
ranean, Atlantic, and Channel, in the course of which coast defense and
attack tactics under new conditions will be engaged in (camouflage, arti-
ficial clouds, and comprehensive utilization of aerial factors). This cruise
is to serve the purposes of naval propaganda, an art yet in its infancy in
France, compared with the way this important side of the sea power question
is managed in England. In Brittany yards the three 8,000-ton cruisers are
shipping their turrets of new design, that are their point of fighting vantage
over the British Effinghams. The 10,000-ton Tourville and Duquesne are
being built at a rapid rate.
The small cruisers Strasbourg and Metz, under Rear Admiral Hallier,
have paid an agreeable visit to Malta, which was an Anglo-French base
during the war (and where the torpedoed battleship Jean Bart was promptly
repaired), previous to their proceeding to Bizerta, that was for so many
years a Franco-British point d'appui against a common enemy. Those times
have come anew as the result of unexpected international happenings that
call for a closer Franco-British entente and mutual assistance against com-
mon perils; and the projected exchange of Anglo-French naval courtesies
in the Mediterranean is a matter of congratulation. Under new interna-
tional conditions, in the light of colonial developments, France and England
stand or fall together, as proclaimed by clear sighted statesmen in our two
countries. This Franco-British interdependence is especially in evidence in
the Mediterranean. It is the same Bocho-Bolshevist influence that is
undermining both British and French influence and safety, with unpre-
cedented and hypocritical means of underhand action.
The trouble the French are facing in Morocco is the very same that is
confronting British rule in Egypt and in India, and the battle may be
considered as being engaged in on the whole Moslem front from Tangiers
to Singapore. On one side, France and Britain, and to a smaller extent
Italy; on the other, the whole force of the barbarous Soviets, backing
and pushing forward the deluded or fanatical Arabs and Mussulmans gen-
erally. Partial disaster (and France is paying for Spanish disasters) will
mean ultimately and surely disaster for the whole line, viz., the collapse
of European colonial empires.
The Riffan problem is a naval problem. Abd el Krim, reduced to his sole
forces and resources, cannot resist long the superior genius, troops, and
armament of Marshall Lyautey, despite the exceptional fighting qualities of
his Moorish partisans. Prospects will be different if that ambitious and
clever African leader continues to receive the moral help that treacherous
Frenchmen are showering upon him, together with financial subsidies from
Russia and reinforcements in men and in material from Bocheland and

Bolshevia. Hostilities on the African front could not go on long without
weakening France at a critical moment when Bocheland, longing for more
land in the sun, and set on her feet again by the stupidity of the Allies,
is displaying a voracious appetite for both Poland and Austria.
To stop at all cost the importation of arms into (nominally) Spanish
Morocco has, therefore, indirectly, become a life-and-death question for
France. An agreement has been reached with Spain that would, of course,
welcome French help with a view to regaining the peaceful possession of
her lawful share of North Africa. A close blockade is to be established
of the Riff coast. Motor gunboats have left Brittany for Morocco and
Oran. The thirty-odd French avisos as Canonnières, rapides (20 knots) of
the Meuse and Arras classes of 700 to 850 tons, that carry either four 4-inch
or two 5.6-inch weapons, besides smaller quickfirers, are suited for block-
ading duties, especially acting in cooperation with patrolling farseeing
aerial scouts and handy motor vedettes.
The victory of France over an enemy that defeated the whole might
of Spain will be due to naval and aerial power mostly, this notwithstanding
the tried valor of French and colonial troops. But for the number (over
two hundred), efficiency, and daring of French aviators, the cost in blood
would have been enormous of dislodging the cute and elusive Riffens from
the steep and craggy mountains in which they had taken a footing and so
cleverly fortified themselves on up-to-date lines. Abd el Krim infantry is
being used as an experimental target to the best aviation in the world, and
chemical warfare will further contribute to shorten the duration of hos-
tilities and to reduce bloodshed. Afghan warfare, which cost England so
much, is the nearest approach to Riff warfare.
Superior speed, under new conditions of warfare, is the key to victory,
since to a great extent all encounters in the last war proved to be contests
of speed, and it is easy to imagine that events would have fared otherwise
had the German fleet possessed an all-round advantage in speed. Speed is
a question not so much of size and finances as of superior technical, scienti-
fic efficiency. Every technical advance realized by a power is tantamount
to an increase in the fighting strength of that power. Dupuy de Lome's
creation of the first steam battleship conferred upon France a crushing
superiority over sailing battle fleets, as showed the Franco-British Crimean
Expedition. Water tube boilers and turbines gave alternately to France
and to England similar advantages to a smaller degree, and it is acknowl-
edged that, quite up to recent years, British and also German systems of
ship propulsion were superior to the French. A better utilization of motor
space, weight, and nominal power has been noted in British battleships,
cruisers, and destroyers than in French units of similar classes.
To catch up all rivals, and even to excel them in that momentous re-
spect, is the policy of the Paris Admiralty. Boiler, geared turbines, and
Diesel studies and experiments are proceeding apace and simultaneously. The
Indret boiler factory (between Nantes and St. Nazaire) has, by degrees, ar-
rived at an incredible ultilization standard of boiler space, passing from
500 square meters of heated surface in the Waldeck-Rousseau type of
boiler (1906) to 980 square meters in the 1920 type, 1,125 in the 1922, and
over 1,300 in the latest types of marine boilers. Experiements on boilers
intended for the 8,000-ton cruisers (Duguay-Trouins) and for the 2,500-ton
contretor pilleurs, have shown their evaporating power to be 25 to 30 per
cent greater than had been expected. The Duguay-Trouins, at first designed
for 100,000 h.p. (eight boilers at 12,500 h.p. each), will develop over 120,000
h.p. with ease, and their speed (34 knots on paper) ought to exceed 36
knots. Similarly, destroyers originally designed for 50,000 h.p. (five
boilers) will reach 60,000 h.p. Relatively to size, the new French ships

will be the most powerful in existence, and the “blue ribbon" of the ocean
(naval) ought to come back to the Tri-color.
In truth, in the past also France excelled by the nominal power of her
ships, but not so much by her speed. For a given paper speed French
ships required greater boiler power. Thus, regarding 10,000-ton croiseurs
cuirassés of twenty-five years ago, 22,000 h.p. caused the British Kent
(Bellevilles) to spurt at 24 knots (and she did so at the Falklands), the
Italian Pisas to exceed 23 knots, and the German Roons to splash on at 21.5
knots, whereas the French Gloires and Montcalms felt panting and uneasy
when hurled forward at over 18 knots in a seaway. It is now acknowledged
that the late chief constructor, Mons. Bertin (though great were his
merits in other respects) designed for over a decade cruisers pleasing to look
at, but suffering from internal complaints unfitting them for exposure in
rough weather at high speed.
The whole of the units of the new program even submarines, have been
built on new lines, that embody experimental data collected since the war,
and are calculated to combine fast running with nautical qualities, which
shows that in their bid for speed supremacy French ingenicurs intend
to neglect no asset.
GERMANY
The Development of German Merchant Shipbuilding
The Shipbuilder, June, 1925.—The Board of Statistics of the German
Government has just published the official figures concerning merchant
shipbuilding in Germany during 1924, which have been compiled for the
Board by the Germanischer Lloyd. These statistics naturally differ some-
what from those issued by Lloyd's Register of Shipping, as they are pre-
pared on a different basis. They are specially interesting because a distinc-
tion is made between the activities on German and on foreign account,
and because they also include particulars of the river craft constructed.
Tables I and II give particulars of the ships, both for sea-going and
river purposes, under construction during the years 1923 to 1924 inclusive.
On the whole, however, the statistics concerning vessels under con-
struction do not give a very clear idea of the development of German

shipbuilding during the past twelve years, because of the abnormal con-
ditions ruling during and since the war. During the war years work was
delayed on nearly all mercantile vessels, while during 1924 the completion
of tonnage in hand was hastened by the fact that the shipbuilding yards
had not sufficient contracts to keep them fully employed. A more reliable
guide is furnished by Tables III and IV, which show the new tonnage
completed during the years 1912 to 1924 inclusive.

Tables I to IV indicate the great reduction in activity during the years
1923 and 1924, both in connection with ships under construction and ships
completed. Before the war, the capacity of the German yards for the
building of mercantile shipping was estimated at 500,000 tons gross per
annum. Since that time most of these establishments have been extended,
and the yards formerly engaged in warship construction have also turned
their attention to merchant tonnage. In this way, the capacity of the Ger-
man yards has been increased to about 700,000 to 800,000 tons annually, ex-
cluding the yards engaged on the production of river craft. The full
shipbuilding capacity of this country has thus not been utilized up to the
present, and during 1925 the actual output amounted to only about one-
third of the maximum possible. Since the completion of the reconstruction
program of the German shipping companies, no shipbuilding contracts of
any magnitude have been entered into.
Tonnage Built on FOREIGN ACCOUNT
The activities of the German yards on foreign account have been
much greater since than before the war. This is due to the fact that ship-
builders in this country have had to search diligently for work, whereas
before the war they were generally well employed on vessels for home
owners. The sea-going tonnage completed for foreign owners in the
years 1913-24 inclusive is given as a percentage of the total tonnage built
as follows:

Professional Notes
The large tonnage completed in 1920 for foreign owners was due to
deliveries in accordance with the Versailles Treaty. Since 1923, however,
there has again been increased activity in German shipbuilding yards for
foreign account, and this is still more clearly shown in the relationship
between ships under construction for foreign owners and the total tonnage
being built. The following is the percentage of foreign-owned vessels
under construction in the years 1921, 1922, 1923 and 1924:
Year Per cent
Year Per cent
1921 3.4
1923 16.7
1922 6.9
1924 36.4
Thus, in the year 1924, the enormous slump in the German shipbuilding
industry was due solely to the decrease in contracts for German owners.
THE SPEED OF CONSTRUCTION
It is also interesting to investigate the speed of construction, that is,
the relationship between the tonnage completed in each year and the
tonnage on the stocks at the beginning of that year. Before the war it
was a general rule that about 33 per cent of the ships under construction
were completed in the same year. This percentage, indeed, increased in
1914 to 40, and in the following years the percentages were as under:
Year Per cent
Year Per cent
1915
1920 15

1917
1922
50
1918
1923
1919 20
1924 45
The foregoing figures show the slowing up in the rate of construction
due to the war, and they also prove that the capacity of the German yards
has been greatly increased since the war. The lower percentage for 1924
was caused by the reduction in the number of men employed.
North SEA vs. Baltic Yards
The part played by the yards in the North Sea and Baltic areas re-
spectively has fluctuated considerably. In 1913 about 50 per cent of the
completed tonnage came from each of these two centers. In 1914 the North
Sea area completed 66 per cent of the total tonnage produced. During
the war the production in the two centers was nearly equal, and this was
also the case in 1924, but in 1923 the North Sea area produced about 60
per cent of the total tonnage built in Germany.
Motorship CONSTRUCTION
The development to motorship construction in Germany is shown by the
following statistics, which give the percentage of tonnage equipped with
internal-combustion engines :

The size of the motorships built has increased rapidly during the last
few years. In 1913 the average gross tonnage of motor vessels was 3,567,
while in 1923 it had risen to 5,137. On the other hand, the average size of
steamships has decreased considerably.

ITALY
New Italian Scout Cruisers
The Engineer, 29 May, 1925.—Although not very dissimilar in general
pattern from the flotilla leaders of the British Navy, that designation is not
altogether applicable to the Italian vessels, which appear to have been
built for functions other than the leadership of destroyer flotillas. In
considering their design it is essential to pay heed to local strategic condi-
tions. Though the staunchness of their construction is beyond criticism,
it is clear that they were built mainly with a view to operations in waters
more sheltered than those of the North Sea or the English Channel. Their
true field of action is the Mediterranean, and it is there that their for-
midable powers of offense could be employed to the greatest advantage.
Naval opinion in France, and to some extent in Italy, also, inclines to
the belief that heavy armored ships will be of negligible value in any future
struggle for the mastery of the Mediterranean. This belief is reflected in
the current shipbuilding policies of the two powers, neither of which proposes
to lay down new capital ships. Since the war they have largely devoted
their attention to the building of small, high-speed ships of the destroyer
type, and submarines. More recently, each has laid down several cruisers
of the 10,000 class, though the utility of such ships is still a matter of
dispute among their experts. In this country, seaworthiness is held to be
no less important than speed in the design of a destroyer, and in order
to achieve it there is a readiness to make some sacrifice of armament.
The result is that the average British destroyer, while it may compare un-
favorably in respect of armament with a French or an Italian boat of
approximate tonnage, is probably the better sea boat. For instance, the
original plan of the French Jaguar class, of 2,359 tons, provided for an
armament of six 5.1-in. guns, two 3-in. A.A. guns, and six 21.7-in. torpedo
tubes; while our 1,800-ton leaders of the Admiralty class carry five 4.7-in.,
one 3-in. A.A., and six 2-in. tubes. One of the 5.1-in. guns was subsequently
deleted from the French vessel, but even after the reduction in weight, she
is expected to prove rather lively in a seaway. The Italian ships of the
Leone group, though only 365 tons heavier than our Admiralty boats, mount
eight 4.7-in. guns, two 3-in, A.A., and six tubes. In proportion to displace-
ment, they are the most heavily armed ships now afloat. Since it is patent
that vessels with this formidable battery are not intended to serve primarily
as torpedo craft, they must be regarded as small scouting cruisers, in
which the torpedo is subordinate to the gun.
Building programs now in hands indicate that the naval forces to be as-
sembled in the Mediterranean a few years hence will include a large quota
of such ships, possessing the velocity of destroyers, reasonable sea-keeping
properties, and a powerful gun armament. Much talk is heard in continental
naval circles of the decisive results to be expected from tactical cooperation
by swift cruisers, light scouts of the type referred to, submarines and air-
craft. It is argued that a composite force of this character could absolutely
close the Mediterranean against an orthodox battle-fleet of greater ag-
gregate strength.
The design of the Leone class was prepared in 1916-17, probably as a
retort to the heavy destroyers then being built for the Austro-Hungarian
Navy, but the exigencies of war postponed the actual laying down of the
ships to 1921, by which date two of the five units originally projected
had been cancelled. The Leone, with her sister vessels Tigre and Pantera,
were built, engined, armed and equipped by the famous Ansaldo firm at
Sestri Potente, the building period averaging rather more than three years.

The excellent workmanship put into structure and machinery is at once
apparent to the critical eye. Despite the great importance attached to speed,
the scantling is moderately heavy and the hull is well subdivided. The
length between perpendiculars is 359.6 ft., the extreme breadth 33.8 ft.,
the draught 11.5 ft., and the displacement 2,165 tons. The freeboard at all
points is considerably higher than that of our largest flotilla leaders.
The general lines of the hull appear to be modeled on those of the
Mirabello class of destroyers, which are said to be capital sea boats. There
are no anti-rolling tanks, nor has the German device of employing the
oil bunkers for that purpose been resorted to; yet the ships, though carrying
so heavy a deck load, are remarkably steady. The long cruise of several
thousand miles in which they are at present engaged has afforded fre-
quent opportunities of testing them under varying conditions of weather,
and their officers profess complete satisfaction with the behavior of all three
ships. Absence of vibration even at high speed, and the narrow are through

which they roll and pitch, make them - eady gun platforms, a quality of
high importance having regard to their ctical functions.
The propelling machinery comprises oi two high-pressure and two low-
pressure turbiries of Parsons type, the former running at 3,400 and the
latter at 1,800 revolutions per minute, transmitting power to the twin
shafts through gearing which reduces the speed of rotation to 420 revolu-
tions. On her full-power trials, the Leone developed more than 50,000
shaft horsepower, maintaining an average speed of 34.5 knots. Steam is
taken from four Yarrow oil-burning boilers. Engine and boiler spaces are
bulkheaded in accordance with the latest practice, and the principle of
duplication has been followed so far as space and weight permit. Here
and there among the auxiliary machinery one notices well-known British
types, but the whole of the material itself is of Italian manufacture.
Excepting the two 3-in. A.A. guns, which are placed one each side at
the break of the forecastle, the entire armament is disposed along the
center line. The eight 4.7-in. 45-cal. guns are on twin mountings. The
first pair, being stationed well away from the eyes of the ship, can be

fought even when she is running into head seas and taking water over the
bows, the sighting and laying of the guns under such conditions being
facilitated by an armored shield for each of the two gun layers. These
shields are placed respectively at the right and left hand of the mounting
leaving a clear space between for the loading parties, who, however, are
quite unprotected. The general arrangement is eminently practical, and
much superior to the conventional type of destroyer gun mounting. While
the two guns may be worked independently as regards elevation-maximum
angle, 30°—they are, in fact operated and fired as a unit, the practice
being to discharge salvos of four guns at a time. The normal rate of fire
for each gun is four rounds per minute, or eight for each twin mounting.
This rate could easily be accelerated for brief periods if the supply of
ammunition were well maintained, but as there are only two hoists for the
four pairs of guns, it would probably be difficult to keep up a continuous
rapid fire. The guns, it should be added, are non-automatic, and are worked
entirely by hand. They are of the Armstrong model, with a total length
of 18.38 ft., the rifled bore extending for 174.6 in. The weight of the gun
is 4.035 tons. Propelled by a powder charge of 9.6 lbs., the high-explosive
shell, weighing 48.74 lbs, attains an initial velocity of 2,460 foot-seconds.
Shrapnel shell of 55.33 lbs. are also used. The powder charge is enclosed
in a brass case. At the time of our inspection, the guns had not been
equipped for director control, but they are eventually to be fitted with
"follow the pointer" gear, operated from the foretop. Each ship carries
two 12-ft. base Zeiss range finders. With a well trained crew, it is stated,
there is little or no mutual interference by the loading numbers, in spite
of the limited space between the two guns, which are clearly shown in the
illustration. The position of the second and third mountings is such as
necessarily to restrict their field of fire before and aba ft the beam, but that
is a defect common to all small ships with an armament disposed along the
keel line.
The two anti-aircraft pieces, of 3-in. caliber discharge a high-explosive
shell of 14 lbs. and shrapnel of 15 lbs. Italian naval officers are inclined
to question the utility of these guns for the purpose in view, and would
prefer a more numerous armament of i-pdr. or 2-pdr. pompoms for use
against aircraft. The six torpedo tubes, mounted on triple carriages,
discharge the 18-in. Whitehead torpedo, Italy having for some reason de-
· layed the adoption of the larger torpedoes which are now used by other
navies. In the Leone and her sisters the tubes have an unusually long
"spoon,” the object apparently being to carry the torpedo well clear of
the ship before it is released, and also to increase the arc of fire before and
abaft the beam. The offensive properties of the class are further augmented
by a supply of sixty blockade mines per ship, with portable laying gear.
Taken for all in all, these ships are exceptionally powerful for their
size, and appear to represent an admirable combination of the tactical
qualities dictated by Italian requirements. The naval constructors of that
country are second to none in skill. They have produced a succession of in-
genious designs, some of which have visibly influenced man-of-war develop-
ment elsewhere. They might claim to have invented the battle cruiser,
as typified by the Italia and the Lepanto, which were laid down nearly
fifty years ago. In modern times they have repeatedly shown it to be
possible to endow vessels of quite moderate tonnage with a large meas-
ure of fighting power without detriment to seaworthiness. It is because
the units of the Leone class are characteristic specimens of Italian con-
struction that we have dealt with them at some length. In the subjoined
table their leading features are compared with those of recent British and
French flotilla leaders:

Japanese Naval Aims
Engineering, 19 June, 1925.-Although there have been frequent refer-
ences to Japanese naval strength, both in the British and American press,
it is rather curious that no naval writer has, as yet, attempted to analyze
the composition of the Japanese fleet, in order to get some idea of the
strategical purposes for which it is probably intended. At first sight the
problem would appear insoluable without reference to secret archives; but,
in point of fact, it is by no means very difficult, for the Japanese Navy can
only be required for ensuring the flow of vital commodities to the islands in
case of war, or for overseas operations. It will be interesting to take each
of these points in turn, and examine them as closely as statistics and known
facts allow.
Any country which is dependent upon overseas supplies must first ensure
itself an adequate food supply and, after that, secure sufficient quantities
of raw materials for its war industries and munition factories. What are
the naval commitments which attach themselves to each other of these
desiderata?
The principal articles of the Japanese national diet are rice, beans, wheat,
fish, meat, sugar, and salt; and of these rice is the most important. Ex-
cept in the case of fish, the country imports a proportion of its total con-
sumption of all these items; but the sources of supply are fairly concen-
trated. All the rice, meat, and salt required for keeping the population in
health can be obtained from China, Korea, and Formosa. The sugar is,
it is true, largely obtained from the Dutch East Indies, but, in an emergency,
sugar imports could certainly be cut down, and enough sweetening matter
obtained from the very large supplies of home-produced honey. The wheat
imports undoubtedly contain the germ of a serious strategical problem. At
the present moment about half come from the American continent and half
from China ; but the import total grows year by year, and there is a
tendency to depend more and more upon the American market.
British import statistics during the war have proved that the country can
supply large armies on decreased imports of iron, coal, and ores, but that
a large increase in imported oils and chemicals is inevitable. (See Fayle,
History of Sea-Borne Trade, vol. iii, Appendix CIX, page 478.) The exact

quantities of each which is essential depend upon a country's military com-
mitments. A glance at the Japanese trade returns shows that the country
would be able to secure itself all the iron, coal, and copper it needed
from Chinese sources of supply; but that petroleum and rubber can only
be obtained from America and the Dutch East Indies. A great effort has,
however, been made to use the Dutch supplies as much as possible, for only
about a quarter of the total imports of oil fuel come from the American
Continent. Chemicals are, undoubtedly, obtained largely from Europe ; but,
as a total supply of 2,500,000 tons would probably suffice for a three-years
war, large reserves can always be obtained in peace. For rubber and
cotton the country is mainly dependent upon the Dutch East Indies and
British India, although a certain percentage of cotton comes from America.
These facts leave no doubt as to the exact nature of the Japanese naval
problem. The area enclosed by Korea, the Japanese islands, the Liu Kiu
group and Formosa, on the east and north, and by the Chinese mainland
on the west, must be secured against any adversary. From inside that
area Japan can supply herself with the bulk of what she requires in war.
If it is lost—that is, if Japan's communications with China are cut by an
adversary which establishes a naval force in the China seas-her capacity
for resistance will cease automatically. That, however, is only part of the
problem. The country's dependence upon the Dutch East Indies would in-
crease enormously in war; and as her home production would probably fall
off as men were taken from agriculture and industries, it would be essential
that she should keep open one overseas line of supplies. If she were at
war with a European Power, great efforts would doubtless be made to make
American route secure; and if with the United States, to keep comunications
open with British India and Europe.
An analysis of the present state of the Japanese Navy shows, without
doubt, that those responsible for the country's naval policy have concen-
trated all their thought upon the purely defensive aspects of the naval
problem. The Japanese Navy is admirably designed to keep opponents out
of the vital area between Japan and the Chinese mainland; but it is far
less well equipped to support overseas operations, or even to protect long
lines of communication. The latest units of the cruiser fleet-that is, the
sixteen ships of the Yubari, Kinu and Tatsuta class—are all of the fleet-
cruiser type ; thirteen of them are of the 5,000-ton class, the remaining
three are smaller. The implication is obvious: all the newest cruisers are
to be used for fleet-scouting duties inside the Japanese narrow seas. The
remaining cruisers are, it is true, much heavier, and might certainly be
used for escort or patrol work along an ocean route; but there are only
eleven of them, and of these, six are twenty-five years old.
The existing building program shows the same purely defensive tenden-
cies. The three vessels of the Kinu type are 5,000-ton fleet cruisers; the
remaining six (four Furutakas and two Myokos) are of heavier tonnage;
but when put into service they will only replace the old cruisers which were
completed in 1899. No system of calculation can give the Japanese more
than ten oceanic cruisers, capable of defending or disturbing distant com-
munications, when their present program is completed. Seeing how im-
portant it may be to keep open at least one of the transoceanic routes, one
has to admit that they propose to do it with a very minimum of force. A
quantitative test of the Japanese petroleum requirements in war accentuates
her dependence upon overseas sources of supply, and, indeed, her difficulty in
obtaining what she would need if she were ever engaged with a powerful
naval adversary. Her total yearly imports are, at present about 1,450,000
tons (petroleum and benzine): she would require about two and a half

times as much if a comparison between the British figures for 1913 and 1918
is any guide at all. This means either that the country must accumulate a
reserve of some seven million gallons for a three years war, or else that
some three and a half million additional gallons must be brought into the
country over long oceanic communications during every year she is at war.
This, it must be admitted, is a tremendous commitment, and one the Japa-
nese naval staff could hardly undertake with the purely defensive force at
present at its disposal.
The composition of the Japanese destroyer and submarine fleets leads
irresistibly to the same conclusion. There are only twenty-nine first-class
boats, that is, destroyers of more than 1,000 tons in service, and when their
new units are completed they will hardly have fifty in all. These are small
figures, and it should be remembered that no destroyer of any tonnage is
really fitted for oceanic work.
The Japanese submarine fleet can be dealt with even more briefly.
Their submarines are all adapted for work in the China seas, and they only
possess two boats which could operate as far south as the Dutch East Indies.
The Japanese have, indeed, two peculiar reasons for concentrating upon
that smaller, coastal, type of submarine which French naval experts call
a sous-marin de blocus. First, Japanese foreign trade is contentrated at
Yokohama and Kobe, so that any dislocation of these two places would
automatically upset the distribution of supplies over the whole country;
secondly, the carrying capacity of Japanese railways is low, with the con-
sequence that the coasting trade is a very important factor in the general
machinery of distribution. Strong coastal patrols and powerful mobile de-
ſense at the great commercial harbors are the naval corollaries to this
dependence upon two centers of distribution, Yokohama and Kobe, and the
economic importance of the coastal routes. The Japanese submarine fleet
seems to have been specially designed for these purposes; but, it has to be
admitted that it is numerically weak. A very large number of submarines
would be required for operations in the sea of Japan, and the surplus
available for work round the Japanese coasts would not be great. All
facts therefore combine to prove that the Japanese Navy is designed to de-
fend the vital economic interests of the country, and is not adapted to
disturbing an adversary's communications. It may even be asked, how, in
its present composition, it could successfully defend the European route
from Singapore northwards, against a determined attempt to cut it. The
goods which the Japanese would need most would probably be food stuffs
from British India, and oil and rubber from the East Indies. There would
be ample precedent for treating all as contraband, in which case the neutral
flag would not cover them. The ten or eleven heavy cruisers available for
protecting the traffic would hardly suffice to put it under escort; and if an
enemy succeeded in operating from Manila against the route, no other
measure would suffice to ensure the safe arrival of the essential cargoes.
On these facts it seems safe to sum up the present Japanese program
by saying that it hardly provides adequate defense for the country's growing
dependence upon overseas supplies. If, during the next few years, the
Japanese Government make provision for more cruisers and submarines
of the oceanic type, it will certainly be unjust to accuse them, on that ac-
count, of departing from the cautious defensive policy which at present
animates their whole system of naval defense. Any Japanese government
could undoubtedly make out an unanswerable case for having at least twenty
heavy cruisers, capable of oceanic work along distant communications, and
a large force of submarine cruisers. At present they are contented with a
far lower figure, and show no desire to increase it.

U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
The Shadow of the Rising Sun
By Sir Herbert Russell, Naval and Military Record, 17 June, 1925.-
Within the past few weeks several events of very considerable naval
significance have been recorded. The Japanese have completed their first
submarine cruiser, a craft of 1,700 tons, capable of crossing the Pacific and
back upon her own fuel endurance. The official report upon the recent
United States naval maneuvers has been published, and the result of this is
an urgent demand for the fortifying of Honolulu, and the effective garrison-
ing of the Hawaiian Islands. The Australian cruiser Brisbane has visited
Yokohama, and the Japanese press has made it quite clear that this friendly
act is regarded as a kind of “gesture of counterblast" to the Australian visit
of the United States Pacific fleet. Admiralty appointments have been made
to Singapore which indicate that the work of developing that base is now
being entered upon in earnest.
There is nothing out of the normal in any of these events, but, taken
collectively, they certainly serve to accentuate the fact that strategical con-
sideration is now centered in the Pacific. The degree of international
comment caused by the prolonged cruise of the United States Pacific fleet
impelled the Navy Department to issue a manifesto upon the subject,
pointing out, in effect, that there was really nothing for any other power
to worry about in this unusual parade of armed force. We are told that the
recent annual maneuvers of the British and French Aeets in the Mediter-
ranean, and of the Japanese feet in its own waters, caused no "alarm”:
why, then, should the American naval maneuvers cause any "aların"? There
have been no recent British naval maneuvers, only combined fleet exercises.
The French maneuvers were confined to the idea of guarding the route be-
tween Toulon and the North African possessions in the event of war. The
scheme of the Japanese operations I know nothing about, but from the
fact that these were carried out in local waters, it seems reasonable to
assume that they were of a defensive character.
The United States naval maneuvers were a grand strategical demon-
stration of the ability of the Pacific fleet to maintain command of the
central Pacific. Honolulu was the base, and it was a part of the scheme
that Honolulu should be attacked, and should succumb. The result furnishes
an adequate justification for the plea to render Honolulu invulnerable to
such an attack, but strategical maneuvers are apt to be regarded as a re-
hearsal for realities: they postulate conditions which would be very likely
to arise in the event of hostilities. The suggestion of an attack upon
Honolulu, and the emphasizing of the necessity to effectively fortify Hono-
lulu, naturally gives rise to the question what power is likely to attack
Honolulu ? Incidentally, certain Japanese newspapers have put forward this
hypothetical point-and answered it.
I admit that we must concede an equal right to ask the same question in
connection with Singapore. The opponents to the scheme of development
in the House of Commons have asked pointblank who is threatening us in
the Pacific, and to the answer that nobody is threatening us, they add the
question as to whether it is not really a provocative act to proceed with de-
fensive measures against a non-existent menace? This is very plausible
reasoning, but it is pure sophistry, since, followed to its logical conclusion, it
negatives both the prudence and the necessity for naval defense in peace
time at all,
Since the United States undertook not to further fortify Manila nor
Guam at the Washington Conference, she is left without any adequate
fleet base in the Pacific. Honolulu, strategically, is of very inferior value
to either of the other two places, but it is far better than no base at all.

To the question as to why the United States needs naval bases in the
Pacific, the obvious answer is because she maintains a Pacific fleet. Rightly
or wrongly, she assumes that any conceivable menace to her shores will
come by way of the Pacific. The simplest and surest way of ensuring
that it shall not come is by being prepared to meet it. In this country we
may regard the United States as rather unnecessarily demonstrative in her
method of proclaiming this preparation. It somehow scarcely fits in with
her plea for peace and disarmament, but as to the wisdom of her policy
there can be no question. Facing her across the Pacific is a first-class power
with a first-class navy. There is only one sane response to such a confront-
ment. It is the response which England (and I write England deliberately,
for any Scotsman or Welshman to strike out if he pleases) has steadily
made for the past four centuries.
Despite the incessant, and not uniformly genial references to the British
Navy in the United States, I think we may definitely take it that the real
objective of American sea power is Japanese sea power. I would go
further, and say that a study of Japanese naval policy (as far as it is
revealed to the world) and of the character of Japanese naval shipbuilding
leads us to the view that the real objective of Japanese sea power is
American sea power. I do not suggest the necessary existence of any
hostile attitude in this posture of affairs. The knowledge that the per-
fectly friendly man across the street carries a revolver in his hip-pocket
need not cause you to conclude that he is only awaiting a favorable oppor-
tunity for a shot at you, but it might very possibly give you the idea of
carrying a revolver, too.
Today the United States and Japan are rivals in the Pacific-friendly
rivals, if you will, but still rivals. Japan has risen to great naval strength
since her war with Russia, and the United States views this strength with
concern. This is the explanation of the rivalry. At one time the pos-
sibility of a Japanese descent upon the shores of California was openly
talked about, and at one time it was undoubtedly a perfectly feasible thing
to attempt. The United States decided that it should no longer remain in
the category of comparatively easy practicability. The completion of the
Panama Canal gave her the first great opportunity of effective defensive
measures. Today she is in a position in which Japan cannot threaten her.
But the vital question is as to whether the time may not come when she
will threaten Japan?
It is not within my present purpose to attempt a review of the circum-
stances under which such a situation might arise. They are sufficiently re-
vealed to any student of the trend of events in the Far East. Not one of all
these possible causes of war but is quite capable of peaceful settlement.
The fact that they remain possible causes of war in the meantime is, how-
ever, a sufficient reason for the maintenance of armaments upon a scale
adequate to the waging of war. I do not believe there is any serious pros-
pect of war for as far ahead as it is humanly possible to look; but at the
present day there remain only three great navies in the world, and when
we think of the possibility of naval warfare we instinctively think of these
three navies. Our own policy is to keep the peace at any price to which honor
and common sense could consent. There remain only the fleets of the
United States and Japan to consider, and it is only natural to assume that
if they ever come to fighting at all they will fight one another. I am not
ignoring the existence of the other great sea powers, but these have now
accepted a policy of purely defensive measures. Harboring no aggressive de-
signs, they are no longer maintaining forces equal to undertaking aggressive
warfare.

Thus it has come about that what the modern strategist terms, the
"focal zone" has become centered in the Pacific. Such an unprecedented
widening of strategical outlook is likely to exercise a marked effect upon
change. The only justification for big dimensions in a submarine is the
naval design. The gigantic submarine is undoubtedly one product of the
necessity of long-distance cruising; her great asset of concealment is re-
duced as her displacement is increased and her tactical mobility is lessoned.
When the Admiralty despatched K-26 on a voyage to Singapore and back
last year they incidentally gave us a pretty good clue to the tactical idea
embodied in the X-1, and in the still bigger submarine which is to follow
her. The question of the value of the capital ship in relation to wide
ocean distances is bound to come under serious review, but I do not want
a revert here to a topic which I have been discussing a good deal of late.
A conflict between the United States and Japan would be a great war.
Our own attitude toward such a struggle is almost impossible to conceive.
Much, of course, would depend upon the casus belli, and the development
of the war. On the face of it, the odds appear overwhelmingly against Japan,
since there is no comparison between her capacity of endurance and that of
the United States. Strategical conditions probably would be heavily in
favor of Japan, since America would have to carry the war into the region
of Japanese choice. If one seeks the possible cause of such a war we na-
turally think of China, and of the situation which may arise when Japan,
bound to find expansion for her teeming population, is driven into a policy
which conflicts with the interests of the United States, for the interest of
the United States in China is very much greater than is generally realized
in this country. It is not an altruistic interest; not an unselfish interest;
and I am not sure that the Japanese are wholly wrong when they say that
there is a distinct savor of the Monroe Doctrine about it. Not this year,
nor next year, are we likely to see anything in the way of an ominous situa-
tion over this question, but the cloud is hovering over the horizon of the
future and casting a shadow of ominous import over the Pacific zone.
UNITED STATES
Economics of the Next Naval Conference
Scientific American, July, 1925.—The naval bill which went through last
winter requests the President to call another conference "by which arma-
ments shall be effectually reduced and limited in the interests of the peace
of the world, and the relief of all nations from inordinate and unnecessary
expenditures for armaments and preparation for war." Our Appropriation
Bill for the fiscal year 1926 carries the following items :
Personnel
.........$174,000,000
Operation and upkeep of ships .....
Aviation ...............
15,000,000
Public Works and repairs of Yards and Docks ........ 9,000,000
Increase of Navy (new ships construction) .......... 7,000,000
All other items (administration, War College, etc.) ... 8,000,000
.
74,0
0,000
Total Budget ..........
u Duaget ..................................$287,000,000
It is evident that if any considerable reduction in expenditures is to be
made, it must be in the first two items of "Personnel” and “Operation
and Upkeep of Ships.” The present ratio of strength of the United States,
Great Britain and Japan is 5-5-3. It has been suggested that if the per-
sonnel, or pay expenses, and those for keeping our ships in full commission
were cut in half in each navy, and the ratio were renamed 272-272-212 it

would be possible to save at a stroke $87,000,000 in the pay bill and
$37,000,000 in the operation and upkeep of ships; for, with the personnel
cut in half, eventually only half as many ships as at present would be
maintained in full commission, the rest being held in reserve; and we would
realize a saving of $124,000,000 without in any degree impairing the relative
treaty strength of the three countries concerned.
Whether such a drastic cut is desirable or no, it is for the nations con-
cerned to say. The mere suggestion of such a thing would, of course,
arouse a perfect tornado of opposition, not only in our own Navy, but in
those of Great Britain and Japan. Nevertheless, the thing is logical.
If we want to prevent “inordinate and unnecessary expenditures," here is
the only way to do it; since appropriations for aviation, public works, new
ships and administration are already cut to the bone.
The Scientific American does not say that this halving of the personnel
of the three navies should be done. We merely offer the suggestion for
the serious consideration of our readers. Think it over!
American Fleet Outranges British, Asserts Bywater
By Hector C. Bywater, The Baltimore Sun, 22 June, 1925.—London,
June 10.-A new turn has been given to the debate on naval ratios in
general, and the gun elevation problem in particular, by publication of the
testimony heard by the subcommittee of the House Committee on Appro-
priations, which recently inquired into the question of United States naval
strength.
Some of the data brought out by this hearing are of a very remarkable
character, but the whole report is highly instructive.
Here for the first time really accurate figures of American and British
gun ranges are presented. They show the gun power of the United States
battle fleet to be greater, and that of the British fleet less, than was sug-
gested by unofficial figures previously circulated in the American press.
More than this, they indicate clearly that in a duel at the extreme range
at which, according to certain American naval critics, the first decisive hits
will be scored, the United States fleet would possess an overwhelming ad-
vantage, being able to bring a 5-1 concentration of heavy guns to bear.
So far from the United States fleet being outranged, the shoe is on the
other foot, judging from these figures. Uncle Sam now has five battleships
armed with 14-in. and 16-in. guns, which range from 34,500 to 35,500 yards.
The five ships mount between them forty-eight of these weapons.
In the British fleet of today there is not a single gun of corresponding
range. The Hood has eight 15-in. guns able to fire up to 30,300 yds., but all
other British ships are limited to a range of 24,300 yds. or less.
A British admiral approaching to engage the United States battle squad-
rons would find himself in an unenviable position. If visibility was high
and the American aircraft spotting efficient, his ships would first come under
heavy fire at a range of twenty miles. Not until he had reduced the dis-
stance by three miles could he send a single shot in return, and then he
would have only eight guns in action against forty-eight.
It is, however, improbable that he would be allowed to reduce the dis-
tance, for the collective speed of his fleet would be no higher than that
of the Americans, and the latter would take good care to maintain their
overwhelming tactical advantage by turning away every time their opponent
tried to close the range.
With forty-eight guns firing at them, hits on the British ships would
be likely to be numerous, even at this great distance, and since the shells
would fall at a steep angle, plunging through the decks and exploding in

U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
the bowels of the ship, they would be far more destructive than ordinary
flat trajectory fire. Given reasonably accurate shooting, the best of the
British battleships might be knocked out long before their own guns could
reach the target.
The British position will undergo improvement two years hence when
the new ships Nelson and Rodney are commissioned, for their 16-in. bat-
teries are certain to have a very long reach, but even then the American
ficet will have five long-range ships against three.
The whole American case for enlarging turret-gun elevation pivots on
the theory that with modern methods of fire control the only limit of
effective shooting is that imposed by (1) visibility and (2) the ballistic
qualities of the gun. The decisive range—that is, the range at which
sufficient hits are registered to determine the issue of the combat-has been
fixed somewhat arbitrarily at 23,000 to 24,000 yds., because this happens to
be the distance at which eight American battleships would be unable to
use their guns.
If the American postulate is sound, decisive results may be looked for
with equal confidence at ranges above 25,000 yds., in which case the United
States fleet already has a tactical preponderance that is overwhelming.
These figures certainly weaken the case for gun-elevation, which has
hitherto rested on premises now exposed as fallacious. It would be per-
missible for the British to argue that the range inferiority of America's
eight oldest ships no more than offsets the immense superiority of her five
newest ships—that, in fact, the existing position strikes a neat balance be-
tween the collective batteries of the two fleets.
Compared with the Japanese battleship force, the United States fleet has
a big lead in gun power. It possesses five ships ranging up to 34,500-35,500
yds., and five that can shoot up to 24,000 yds. Japan has only two ships with
a range of 30,000 yds., and over. Her other eight ships are restricted to
24,000 yds.
The House subcommittee investigation has done good service by showing
up the exaggerated statements made last year by certain naval agitators
whose zeal ran away with their discretion. They did their best to prove
that, while the British and Japanese Navies were maintained at the topnotch
of perfection, the American Navy was rotten to the core.
The plain truth is that every naval service has become more or less
deficient since the war, owing to the imperative need for economy, but
there is nothing to show that the American fleet has suffered more than
others frorn this enforced parsimony. It is only that its shortcomings are
advertised a little more freely, perhaps.
There is, of course, a real and very serious shortage of cruisers and
large submarines, which the building program now in hand will do some-
thing to make good. But, in other aspects of material fighting power, the
American Navy will stand comparison with the sea forces of any nation.
AVIATION
General Patrick on Independent Air Force
Aviation, 15 June, 1925.—December 19, 1924. Subject: Reorganization
of air forces for national defense. To: The Adjutant General.
It has been evident to me for some time that the existing organization
and method of administration of the Army Air Service present many com-
plex problems, not a few of which are peculiar to this branch alone. In
the general consideration of the major problems of the Army there are
repeatedly found exceptions pertaining to the Air Service which place ad-
ditional burdens upon the War Department as a whole, when possibly the

Professional Notes
Air Service alone should be held responsible for their solution. Several
methods have been suggested to rectify the present difficulties; none has
yet met with general approval.
The Air Service is a growing factor in national defense; from day to
day its rôles become increasingly important; many phases of our war plans
must be constantly altered to keep pace. In any future emergency involving
our military forces, particularly in the early phases thereof, the air force
must be considered one of the vital factors.
The proper development of the Air Service and the determination of
the rôle it shall play in national defense are matters which deserve, and
should receive, the most careful consideration. The Air Service must be so
organized and maintained that it may be able to meet effectively the
responsibilities placed upon it.
I am convinced that the ultimate solution of the air defense problem of
this country is a united air force; that is, the placing of all the component
air units, and possibly all aeronautical development under one responsible and
directing head. Until the time when such a radical reorganization can be
effected certain preliminary steps may well be taken, all with the ultimate
end in view.
The transition to the ultimate solution will require time and study and
the passage of careful prepared legislation. This step should not be
taken hastily. However, there is an immediate need for certain remedial
measures. Legislation to place into effect the provisions of the Lassiter
Board, approved in principle by the Secretary of War over a year and a
half ago, should be enacted at once and so broadened as to incorporate
features for the development of the Air Service along the lines indicated
herein. To place upon the Chief of Air Service additional functions which
would relieve the War Department of certain of its responsibilities toward
the Air Service is not without precedent, as evidenced by the Marine Corps,
which is not a part of the Navy Department but is under the Secretary of
the Navy. In fact, some such organization as this might be a very appro-
priate step to take at this time. As in the case of the Marine Corps,
such a reorganization need not contemplate duplication of any activity which
could be efficiently carried on by existing War Department agencies.
There are many details, in addition to those appearing in the succeeding
paragraphs, relating to the present status of the Air Service and its ad-
ministration under the War Department, which should receive consideration.
The purpose of this paper is to show that an unsatisfactory condition
exists and that, in order for the Air Service to develop and assume its
proper place in national defense a departure from present methods must
be inaugurated.
The commissioned personnel problem is most serious and perplexing.
This service suffers nearly half of all the deaths annually in the Army-in
1921, 42 per cent; in 1922, 43 per cent; in 1923, 47 per cent; in 1924, 41
per cent_and yet the replacement of this personnel peculiarly adapted to
Air Service requirements, must in general follow the same system as pro-
vided for the other branches of the Army. The principle of placing reserve
officers on active duty in the Air Service for long periods of time has been
recognized by the Lassiter Board and approved April 24, 1923, by the
Secretary of War; yet the number so carried is negligible under War De-
partment appropriations. The position of the great bulk of the junior
officers of the Air Service on the promotion list is deplorable. Early in
1922 the Shanks Board appointed by the War Department reported in part:
“The board is of the opinion that this situation will affect adversely the
efficiency of the Air Service. .... The Air Service is the only branch or
arm of the service which is adversely affected as a corps by the promotion

U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
situation.” Several methods have been suggested by me to rectify these
difficulties under which the Air Service is at present laboring, and yet the
status of my officers remains unchanged.
The flying personnel of the Air Service requires training very different
from that of others. Training policies of the War Department must carry
exceptions or special regulations be provided for the Air Service.
The nonflying part of the enlisted personnel for the Air Service should
be primarily mechanicians and technicians. They must be trained specialists.
These enlisted men form practically no part of the actual fighting personnel
of the Air Service, their work is principally the maintenance of the fighting
machine. They are armed only with the pistol. Manifestly, the disciplinary
instruction, drills, and combat maneuvers are not so essential to the prepara-
tion for their mission as in the other combatant branches. Many of the
conditions surrounding their work are not found in the other combat arms.
Accordingly, exceptions are made to many of the general policies of the
War Department for the recruitment, training and employment of the en-
listed man.
The great mobility of the Air Service and the missions it is capable
of performing have created a problem in command, the solution of which is
still far from satisfactory. It is comparatively easy to place limitations-
actual boundaries on the ground-between a theater of operations, a zone of
communications, and a zone of the interior; but for the Air Service these
all merge into one. Command becomes complicated, and somewhat over-
lapping, when air forces, based on airdromes in the zone of the interior
carrying our missions in the theater of operations in connection with the
ground troops or far beyond the hostile lines. The Lassiter Board has
chosen to state that "this force should be organized into large units, insur-
ing great mobility and independence of action." Future emergencies will
require at the very outset, before the ground armies can get under way, and
in many cases before the Navy can make its power effective, the maximum
use of air power on strategic missions. Provision for the command of these
air forces has not been satisfactorily made, nor is it known by me that there
are even provisions for such initial air operations. We should gather our air
forces together under one air commander and strike at the strategic points
of our enemy—cripple him even before the ground forces can come in con-
tact. Air power is coordinate with land and sea power and the air com-
manders should sit in councils of war on an equal footing with the
commanders of the land and sea forces.
Coast defense is a problem which it appears only a united air force can
satisfactorily solve. The functions of the Army and Navy air forces
overlap, and considerable confusion still exists as to the coordination that
is necessary and the functions each service perform in order to secure an
actual and practical defense. As an immediate and practical step toward
efficiency and economy, the Army Air Service should be definitely charged
with all air operations conducted from shore stations. Ultimately all air
forces in the aerial defense of our coasts should be placed under one air
commander and powers delegated to this commander that would permit
the greatest latitude in the performance of his mission.
A proper uniform for the Air Service has heretofore been recommended
by me to the War Department. The high standing collar of the Army ser-
vice uniform is wholly inappropriate for use by flying personnel. Medical
officers have recommended against it and fliers themselves have repeatedly
complained of its interference in the performance of their duties. The
present uniform is also unsuited for work about aircraft. The Chief of Air
Service should be authorized to submit a design for a suitable uniform for

his officers and men. Morale, as well as Aying and working efficiency, would
be greatly increased thereby.
Estimates from year to year for the Air Service are in accord with the
prescription of the War Department. Cuts in the Budget have naturally
been shared by the Air Service. In his first message to Congress the Presi.
dent said: “Additional planes are needed for the Army. .
."
The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics stated in its annual re-
port last year: "Whatever may be the demands of economy, serious consid-
eration must be given to the increasing relative importance of aircraft in
warfare, and funds appropriated to equip and maintain adequately the Air
Service of the Army and Navy.” In sending this report to Congress, the
President laid particular emphasis on the importance of continued develop-
ment of military and naval aviation. I believe if the entire estimates for the
Air Service were considered apart from those for the Army and the Chief
of Air Service designated to defend them under a separate appropriation
title, benefits would accrue to both the Army as a whole and the Air Ser-
vice in particular.
The Air Service is a supply branch and its work as such is almost en-
tirely for its own service. Methods applicable to a supply branch like the
Quartermaster Corps or the Ordnance Department, that supply several
branches of the Army, are not always adaptable to the Air Service. Air
Service procurement, storage and issue problems, and the policies regarding
distribution and usage are matters that should be a responsibility of the
Chief of Air Service, guided by very general policies established by the
Secretary of War.
In furtherance of my conviction, as stated in paragraph 4, above, that
additional responsibilities should be placed upon the Chief of Air Service,
I recommend that immediate action be taken on the following:
Legislation should be prepared to make effective the provisions of the
Lassiter Board for the expansion and development of the Air Service and
this legislation should be submitted to Congress, accompanied by a special
message from the President, setting forth its importance, in time for action
to be had thereon not later than in the first session of the Sixty-ninth
Congress. The recommendations of this board were approved in principle
by the Secretary of War on April 24, 1923, and later in detail, after the
joint board had given careful consideration and made only minor changes.
(J. B. No. 349, Sept. 11, 1923.)
Legislation should be prepared for the reorganization of the Air Service
and as an air corps apart from the War Department. This legislation
should be submitted to Congress, accompanied by a special message from
the President setting forth its importance, in time for action to be had
thereon not later than in the first session of the Sixty-ninth Congress. The
work in preparation and submission of this legislation should not operate
to delay action in making effective the recommendations contained in (a)
above. Among the provisions that should be included in this reorganiza-
tion are:
There should be in war plans one air commander, who, in at least the
initial stages of an emergency, should control all operations of the air
forces, both in the performance of distance strategic missions and in joint
action with the land and sea forces.
The Army Air Service should be definitely charged with all air opera-
tions conducted from shore bases.
The Chief of Air Service should be responsible for the tactical training
and efficiency of all Air Service units with a doctrine first of offensive ac-
tion. This should include the means to secure and assure this efficiency.

The Chief of Air Service should be required to submit and defend legis-
lation necessary to maintain a proper system for the procurement, assign-
ment, promotion, elimination and retirement of his personnel. The sources
for the procurement of commissioned personnel should include all these
now employed by the War Department.
The Chief of Air Service should be authorized to submit the design of
a uniform suitable for the requirements of his corps.
Estimates for the entire cost of the Air Service should be prepared by
the Chief of Air Service under one appropriation title and defended by him
before Congress.
The Chief of Air Service, in addition to being responsible for the pro-
curement, storage and issue of all items peculiar to the Air Service, should
formulate the policies regarding their distribution and usage. He should
also be responsible for transportation by air of personnel and supplies.
The time has arrived for constructive legislation which will provide for
the expansion and development of the Air Service and I urgently recom-
mend that action be immediately taken by the War Department to bring
this matter to the attention of Congress.
The Performance of Future Airplanes
U. S. Air Services, July, 1925.—Major H. H. Arnold.Most people
would say that the history of aeronautics has not been such as to warrant
anybody's making any sort of prediction for the future. There is, how-
ever, a fair enough basis on which to estimate something about how fast,
how far, and how high airplanes of various types may be expected to go in
the next four or five years. The value of a performance characteristic
prediction is obvious. In the military field such predictions must be made
constantly if our national defense is to keep apace with other nations. In
the commercial and sporting worlds such estimates are necessary if our
planes are to compete on the race course and in aerial transportation with
other nations.
In the set of curves which accompany this article it has been my effort
to present curves that will show the trend of design rather than the per-
formance of any particular airplane. To avoid confusion, I shall discuss
in the following paragraphs the subject of airplane speeds, ceilings, and
endurance in order.
The speed of heavier-than-air craft has, perhaps, received more popular
attention than any other one characteristic. This is due, no doubt, to the
fact that the airplane's speed is so much greater than that of any other
vehicle. The curve showing the world's record for maximum speed is
shown as beginning with about 150 miles an hour in 1917. As a matter of
fact, no world record was made in that year. However, that point was
selected as a representative point on the upward slope of the curve, where
actual engineering design had begun to appear. From 1913 to 1917, many
events transpired to change the form of this curve. The World War inter-
vened, during which no efforts were made at setting world's records. From
the point of view of design it was not until after the war that engineers
really set about the work with the same scientific attack applied to other
engineering problems. In 1919 the first postwar record of about 166 miles
an hour was made by a Frenchman. That speed has been regularly in-
creased, the record going back and forth between the United States and
France until at the present time the record stands a little over 278 miles
an hour.
It is of interest in passing to speculate as to what the form of the curve
would have taken had not the war intervened. It is certain that airplane

that the curve would have reached greater heights during the years 1915-17
had there been no war. The slope, however, probably would not have been
quite as steep had it begun at that time. It may be that about the same
point would have been reached at the present date, although a more gradual
development would have brought it about. From this same line of reason-
ing, we wonder what the continuation of the curve in the next few years
will be. Will it follow the dotted portion shown on the chart, or curve
downward, or possibly incline more steeply upward?
All of the queries in the preceding paragraph are, of course, difficult to
answer because they are in an area as yet unexplored. In the case, however,
of the curves showing the performance of pursuit, observation and bom-
bardment airplanes which lay a considerable distance below the world's
record speeds, the trend in the near future is not so obscure. We are here

only traveling over a path already opened by the world's record craft. It is,
then, a fair guess that the speeds of the various types may be expected to
follow approximately the curves shown in the dotted portion of the chart.
Returning to the maximum speed curve, it is worth while to consider
if we may expect a high speed limit or at least what factors might enter
into it. First of all, unless some method is discovered for protecting the
pilot, speeds much greater than that of the present world's record will be
difficult of attainment on account of the effect on the human body. On the
other hand, the airplane itself is going to have to undergo some big changes
if we are to continue up the incline shown by the dotted line. Somewhere,
we know, there should be a "terminal velocity" governed by the head re-
sistance of the airplane and the power available to drive it. When this
point is reached, however, it is probable that the wings of the airplane will
have mostly disappeared, it being presumed that sufficient lift to support
the craft in the air will be provided at such great speeds with an extremely

small amount of surface. It is worthy of mention also, that before such
speeds are reached, we shall also have to progress considerably further in
the matter of propeller design. Because of all these requirements, it is
hardly prudent to predict just where the maximum speed record will fall
in 1929. However, as pointed out before, the same difficulty does not apply
to service airplanes, inasmuch as even though they followed the curves
extended as shown, they would arrive in 1929 at a speed much less than the
present world's record.
While on the subject of military aircraft and great speeds, it is by no
means certain just how great a speed is desirable. It is, of course, possible
to build a pursuit airplane that will travel fifty, seventy-five, or possibly
more miles an hour faster than the present ones. The question then arises

whether there will be any value in having such a pursuit airplane. Would
it be possible to maneuver it? Would it ever be necessary to maneuver it?
If the craft were itself capable of maneuvering at such extreme speeds,
could the pilot stand it, and at the same time would it be possible to manipu-
late fighting equipment fast enough to be effective? These are some of the
questions, then, that may be expected to influence the pursuit speed curve
as well as matters of pure airplane design.
In the case of observation and bombardment airplanes, even though the
curves are extended along the lines they have been going, we are again
below the excess speeds of the pursuit craft. Observation and bombardment
airplanes have certain characteristics which must be maintained, which may
in the future limit speed more than they have in the past. In other words,
it may be that the curve extensions will not be as indicated by past per-
formances.

In observation airplanes, greater and greater radii of operation are
being required. This, in turn, means that a greater load of fuel must be
carried. If a greater load of fuel is to be carried, this, in turn, may intro-
duce features of design which will cut down the speed unless a new power
plant appears.
In the case of bombardment, the same reasoning applies as to observa-
tion craft. Every day greater loads of bombs are demanded and at the
same time the ability to carry them further into enemy territory. The de-
sign of an airplane is a compromise and consequently if we get great load
carrying and endurance we must sacrifice some other characteristic.
This reasoning, of course, will be overthrown in the event that a power
plant is discovered which weighs only a fraction of our present power
plants for the same horse power and which requires only a fraction of the
fuel on which to operate.
In the past, several designers have made the mistake of designing their
airplane as of today, knowing full well that it could not be produced ready
for flying in less than about a year. The result has been that at the date
of production the airplane was a year behind the times. This is strikingly
shown on the observation curve by the small triangle (a), (b), (c). If an
airplane is to be designed in 1925, which will be produced in 1926, then it
must be designed for the characteristics shown by point (b) on the curve,
Otherwise, it will have a speed less than it should equal to (b-c), which
ten or fifteen miles might be quite serious in case of war, with a country
whose engineers had designed their airplanes with advanced requirements
in mind. If this same line of reasoning is applied to a four-year develop-
ment program, when present-day standards are used, it will be seen by the
curves that we might arrive in 1929 with an observation airplane of bom-
bardment speed, as shown at point (d), instead of the speed it should
have, shown at point (e).
A study of the curves of the world's altitude records and the altitude
curves of military aircraft show much the same characteristics as the speed
curves discussed above. Unfortunately, the present world's altitude record
does not tally very well with the present average ceilings of service type
airplanes. For this reason the trend of the curve is not as indicative as it
might be. In other words, it is difficult to tell whether or not the curve
should take the form shown by the dotted portions A or B..
In any event, the curves will be materially affected by the development
of apparatus especially made for the operation of airplanes at high alti-
tudes. This apparatus will include superchargers for the engine and some
sort of provision for the pilot, either in the way of oxygen breathing equip-
ment, electrically heated clothing, or air-tight cockpits.
Again we arrive in our discussion as to the altitude which may be de-
sirable for military purposes. In the case of bombardment airplanes, it
will be affected by the accuracy of bomb sights, the climb and endurance
of the craft, and possibly to some slight degree by the development of
anti-aircraft guns. In the case of observation, average visibility and the
range of photographic equipment will be important factors. In pursuit air-
planes it is presumable that for some time to come we will go on striving
for greater altitude characteristics because the advantage to the pilot who
is able to fly above his adversary is yet of importance. Whether this im-
portance is lessened by excess speed is something of a question. The choice
may be even forced as to whether we desire pursuit airplanes for extremely
high altitudes or for extremely great speeds.
The endurance of airplanes from a military viewpoint is always of the
utmost importance. The world's record at the present moment is nearly
thirty-eight hours. If the curve continues regularly, we may expect in the

next two or three years an endurance record of forty-two hours or more.
What this means to military aviation is that presently a limit will be reached
beyond which, with present fuel and engines, it will be impossible to go.
We shall then have arrived at the same point in this direction cited as
"terminal velocity" in the case of speed records. This may be upset at any
moment by the same development of power plants as mentioned above.
Assuming, however, that such a level for the curve is found, then the design
of military aircraft is a simple matter of compromise between fuel load and
distance.
Curves showing the progress of military airplanes in the matter of en-
durance have not been presented, since the development has not been rapid
or accelerated enough to make the curve of interest. Pursuit airplanes for

several years have had an endurance of from one and one-half hours to
two and one-half hours, which is still the case. At the end of the war the
Caproni and Handley-Page Bombers were capable of three or four hours
endurance and today our long distance bombers are capable of from seven
to nine hours continuous Aight. Practically the same statement applies to
the observation airplane, the difference being, of course, in the fact that the
observation machine travels at a greater rate of speed.
In conclusion, it seems wise to let each reader make his own prediction
as to what the speed, endurance, and ceiling of various types of airplanes
will be in 1925, 1926, and 1927, from the data given, rather than to put
down figures that might be misinterpreted. The estimate which the reader
makes will be accurate in porportion to the care he exercises in applying
the reasoning set forth.

Airships for Military Purposes
C. deF. Chandler, Lieutenant Colonel, U. S. Army, Retired, U. S. Air
Services, July, 1925.-According to the nomenclature adopted by English
speaking nations several years ago, the term airship refers only to the
dirigible balloon form of aircraft. Structurally, airships are referred to
in three classes : non-rigid, semi-rigid, and rigid types. The smallest and
most simple form is the non-rigid, whereas the rigid type, of which the
Los Angeles is an example, has a rigid metal frame to maintain its shape.
The semi-rigid is intermediate in size, with structural features that merge
into the smaller and larger classes.
In principle, experience acquired in previous wars is a good basis for
teaching the art of war but often there is disagreement regarding the
lessons deduced from earlier conflicts. The United States Army used no
airships during the World War, while the Navy lacked the opportunity for
operating their few directly against the enemy: consequently little atten-
tion is devoted to military airships at the present time. The important
operations of airships by other nations during the World War is known to
few officers in this country. Both the War and Navy air bureaus give
consideration to the military capabilities of airships, but it is doubtful
whether ground troops understand the extent of the aid that can be rendered
to their several arms by airships of various sizes. The purpose of this
article is to set forth briefly the service that can be expected from airships.
OPERATIONS IN DESERT REGIONS
Southwestern United States, likewise across the Mexican border, is an
extensive region presenting difficulties for ground troops due to lack of
water at convenient distances, together with few roads and railways.
Twenty miles between potable water is not uncommon, and occasionally
water must be consumed that tastes unpleasantly of alkalis. The infre-
quent rains usually come in the so-called cloudburst manner, cutting deep
ruts and arroyas while passing off rapidly over the sun-baked ground.
The vegetation generally consists of small shrubbery such as mesquit, cactus
and sagebush.
The faithful army mule and the more potent motor truck can transport
supplies in these dry regions and have done so successfully, but twenty miles
a day is usually sufficient for ground troops in roadless and waterless re-
gions. Even the more mobile cavalry is seriously hampered by the absence
of forage except for that transported long distances by wagon or motor
truck. With these conditions, operations against bandits by ground troops is
a slow and expensive process of doubtful efficacy as exemplified by the
Punitive Expedition into Mexico in 1916.
Here is a military situation in which small airships of either the non-
rigid or semi-rigid types would prove extremely valuable. The twenty-mile
daily march of infantry corresponds to a half hour flight by a small airship.
Ordinarily, small parties of bandits are able to move much faster than
troops, thus escaping easily unless a very large force is employed thoroughly
to comb a region and occupy it by garrisons in every village.
The superior speed of a small airship permits overtaking parties of
horsemen easily; while the ability to move slowly or stop near the ground
affords the opportunity for observing equipment, camps and questioning
individuals. Machine guns and a few, light bombs enable the airship to
inflict swift and sure punishment if attacked by bandits. A careful in-
spection of fifty square miles of rough country daily should be regarded as
an easy task for a small airship having a crew of only three or four persons.

U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
The area scouted will depend upon the adaptability of the terrain for
concealment and the number of stops required for interrogations.
In this connection, a logical question is, why not employ airplanes to per-
form such missions. The answer is that while airplanes can fly over this
desert region as well as elsewhere, a safe landing without serious damage
to the plane chassis is almost impossible due to the deep ruts and small
shrubbery. Without landing, the airplane is unable to come close to the
ground for satisfactory examinations and interrogations of suspicious per-
sons. It is this feature that makes the small airship particularly suitable
and the airplane unsuitable for operations against bandits in desert regions.
Operations involving hostile armies in any region are preceded by recon-
naissance patrols and contact patrols that can be performed at least in part
by small airships.
The field equipment such as transportable mooring masts and wind-
breaks for sheltering airships moored on the ground, are technical details
outside the scope of this article: these devices are in process of development
by the Army Air Service.
ANTI-SUBMARINE OPERATIONS
An expression frequently mentioned is that in warfare a new means of de-
struction soon results in the development of a counter remedy. The most
effective answer to the submarine vessel is the depth-charge: the manner of
its use from the vessels of the destroyer class is well known. There seems
to be a serious lack of appreciation in America of the proved value of air-
ships carrying depth charge bombs when operating against submarines.
The destroyer attack consists in steaming quickly to the spot where the
wake of the torpedo is first observed and there dropping a depth-charge.
That method permits two chances of error: The wake may not have been
observed at the beginning, or the submarine may have changed its location
after launching the torpedo.
The ability of aircraft observers to see through a considerable layer of
water affords a most valuable advantage. The altitude of aircraft above
the surface allows space for the dispersion of reflected sunlight, whereas the
concentrated reflected light interferes with seeing below the surface when
just above the water. Objects below the surface appear as shadows to aerial
observers. When a dark spot has the general shape of a submarine, the air
pilot has no doubt regarding his target..
Shortly after the World War Armistice, an officer of the Royal Air
Force described to the writer some of his experiences in piloting a small
airship on anti-submarine patrols. When a small spot of oil appeared or
bubble of air rose to the surface of the ocean, the airship regulated engine
speed so as to remain over that position for further careful observation.
Even though a submarine remained quietly at a depth too great to note the
shadow effect, it would not be long before oil or air bubbles betrayed
its presence. Then a depth-charge would be dropped accurately over the
target. At times the destructive effect was so great that personal effects
from the inside of the submarine would come to the surface following the
blast of the depth-charge.
For operations of this nature, a seaplane also could drop a depth-charge
if the target is observed during the brief passage at normal flying speed.
Obviously, the airship is superior for this service because of the ability to
hover while watching suspicious surface spots and at the same time easily
changing altitude according to light effects in searching for target shadow
and other indications.
Previous to equipping airships with depth-charges, the practice was

(1925)

for airships discovering submarines to signal for a destroyer to come; in
the meantime following every movement directly above the submarine.
It is not always possible to know whether a submarine has been destroyed
after attack. One article from British sources reported forty-nine sub-
marines sighted by airship patrols, of which twenty-seven were successfully
attacked. The punishment by almost certain destruction doubtless was
responsible for enemy submarines preferring not to attack vessels convoyed
by airships.
The optical advantage of the airship previously mentioned, permits of
locating submarine mines as well as submarine vessels. The Royal Air
Force reported having sighted 134 mines of which 73 were destroyed.
At first the airship could only summon surface vessels to destroy mines,
but later in the war certain airships carried guns that could and did ex-
plode mines.
AIRSHIP Convoys
Airship convoying surface ships proved to be very effective protection
against submarines. The records of the Royal Air Force show that no
vessels were sunk by submarines while under convoy of aircraft, although
in the same waters the German submarines attacked ships when convoyed
only by destroyers.
Comparing the use of airplanes with seaplanes for convoy service, there
has been an impression that the former require far more personnel for
operation and maintenance. The most convincing answer on this point is
provided by British figures, as follows:
Airplanes
and
3.52
........
Airships Seaplanes
Men employed per hour flown ........ 1.62
Hours flown per men employed ........ 1.04
.40
Average duration of patrol ............ 6 hr. 17 min. 2 hr. 2 min.
When the effectiveness of airships for convoy and anti-submarine ser-
vices became certain, the expansion by the British was rapid toward the
end of the World War. Actually, the number of hours flown by airship in
each year were as follows:
1915
......... 339 hours
1916
................. 7,078 hours
1917 ..............
......22,389 hours
1918
.............................53,554 hours
Similarly the French used airships extensively from a number of stations
along the coast both for convoy and anti-submarine defense, but the opera-
tions statistics have not been made public as quoted above for the British.
Although it is conceded that seaplanes are able to operate in winds
of greater velocity than practicable for airships, it is interesting in this con-
nection to learn that from January 1, to November 11, 1918, there were only
nine days that weather conditions prevented British airships from flying.
During the last seventeen months of the World War, British airships
provided escorts for a total of 2,210 surface vessels; also accomplished
9,059 anti-submarine patrols. While performing these missions the air-
ships cruised nearly one and a half million miles. The total distance
traveled by British airships during the World War period was 2,245,000
miles.
As the atmosphere over the shore bases has the same characteristics as
atmosphere over the ocean, from an airman's viewpoint it makes no differ-
ence in the present division of duties whether the responsibility for this

service rests with the Navy or the Army. Like many things in life, “What
is everybody's business becomes nobody's business," so that little if any-
thing is being done toward providing in time of peace the coast defense
airship stations that will be needed on the first day of the next war.
STRATEGIC RECONNAISSANCE
A rigid type airship having a gas volume of five million cubic feet
should be able to accomplish a non-stop cruise to Europe and return if
all the pay load capacity is utilized for fuel. The military uses for such
a craft should easily be apparent.
It might be well at this time to recall the panic-stricken requests from
every community along the Atlantic seaboard during the early months of
the War with Spain. The exact location of the Spanish fleet was not
known. Each coast city and village was sure that its importance invited
attack. The natural procedure under the circumstances was for each mem-
ber of Congress along the seaboard to demand that the entire U. S. Navy
be stationed so as to protect his district.
In the spring of 1893 the cost of a few large airships, if then procurable,
would have been provided many times most willingly to remove the doubt
regarding the Spanish fleet. Unfortunately, that lesson is being forgotten,
due to time and because our last war was staged 3,000 miles from home.
A British authority on aeronautics has stated that a large airship is
capable of making a reconnaissance of 100,000 square miles of ocean each
day. The first impression may be that the statement exaggerates, but a
brief analysis is sufficient to prove it entirely reasonable. At an altitude
of one mile or more, visability at sea for anything so large as a fleet of
war vessels, is easily fifty miles on each side. Therefore it is only neces-
sary for an airship to travel forward 1,000 miles in a day to investigate
the 100,000 mile area. An airship having a speed of eighty miles an hour
(70 knots) therefore need travel only twelve and one half hours to cover
the area stated.
Admiral Beatty is quoted as saying that one rigid airship can do the
work of six scout cruisers.
MOTHER SHIP FOR AIRPLANES
Airplanes have been released and also attached to airships while in flight.
Whatever has been done once can be done again. When it is a matter of
human skill or engineering development, continued practice quickly produces
improved methods and facilities. The question no longer remains as to the
possibility of employing large airships as carriers for airplanes. After
having proved the case, money should be supplied willingly to follow-up the
experiments already made in this country. Nevertheless, it is advisable
to continue construction of surface vessels as airplane carriers until large
airships have been produced with facilities equal to present surface ships
for this purpose.
The taxpayers who supply the sinews for our national defense are not
much interested whether it is the Navy or the Army or a separate Executive
Department of the Government that develops this important military
arm for their protection, but experience has shown that excuses are never
accepted when the test of war arrives unexpectedly. According to the
organization at present provided by law, it should be the duty of either the
War or Navy Department to construct promptly an airship of at least five
million cubic feet capacity: its principal mission being experimental em-
ployment as an airplane carrier.

A five or six million size rigid airship will fall short of providing a
satisfactory airplane carrier, but for engineering reasons, popularly phrased
as "Safety First," an airship of this size should be constructed and thor-
oughly tested before increasing the gas volume to perhaps ten million cubic
feet which is certain to be ample for the purpose.
Assuming a rigid type airship inflated with ten million cubic feet of
helium, it would be able to accomplish a non-stop voyage to Europe and
return (6,000 miles), allowing reserve fuel supply for an additional 3,000
miles, and still transport a military load of 187,000 pounds of airplanes or
other munitions.
MERCHANT MARINE
The Truth from Admiral Palmer
New York Times, 29 June, 1925.-Admiral Leigh C. Palmer, president of
the Emergency Fleet Corporation, addressed the National Foreign Trade
Convention at Seattle last Friday very frankly. His subject was ships en-
gaged in foreign trade. Admiral Palmer must have made his hearers
gasp when he said:
"After I became president of the Fleet Corporation I spent some time in
looking over the entire situation and shortly came to the conclusion that
the main trouble with our newest infant industry, the government-owned
merchant marine, was that it was suffering from too much easy money.
Instead of its getting down to real business and trying to come some-
where near living within its income, it was depending unduly upon the
national treasury.”
So Admiral Palmer entered upon a policy of getting down to real busi-
ness. He cut out some of the waste. The average loss on 320 cargo vessels
per voyage was reduced from $25,000 to $17,000. This was brought about
by consolidating lines that were in competition with one another and by
dropping ships from the active list. The result was that as many voyages
were made as before, "with a substantial increase of cargo and revenue
and a reduction of operating expenses." Unnecessary personnel in the
Fleet Corporation was eliminated and the payroll reduced in eighteen
months by $2,000,000. And here the Admiral made his hearers gasp
again: "We regard the improvement already made as merely a begin-
ning." He hoped to get the loss per voyage of the Government-owned
cargo fleet down to $8,500 per ship.
So far the prospect was rosier. But if the fleet could not be transferred
to private ownership, replacement with new and improved ships would
have to be faced. What would the cost of that be? Three hundred
-cargo ships are now being operated. Perhaps fifty could be sold. "If
our replacement program," said Admiral Palmer, "calls for twenty vessels
a year, the cost would average about $20,000,000 per year for the new
construction of the cargo fleet alone.” To this would have to be added
replacement of passenger liners and combination passenger and cargo
vessels, at a cost of $10,000,000 a year. “Thus," he went on, "unless the
Government can find a way to transfer its fleet to private ownership, as
contemplated by the Merchant Marine Act, we face the definite prospect
of having to spend about $30,000,000 a year continuously for replacement
alone." With improved administration the entire cost to the Government
of maintenance would be $40,000,000.
That figure of $40,000,000 was bedrock. The Government could not do
the job of operating its ships for less. But the "average American private
owner" could reduce the $13,500 loss per voyage to $4,500, said Admiral
Palmer, and “the same fleet, on similar services if operated under British
conditions would break about even." So this was the conclusion :

[Aug.
U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
"This last figure, $4,500, may be taken as an approximate measure of
the amount of government aid that would be required to place American
vessels on a competitive footing with British vessels."
He was speaking of cargo ships only. Passenger service constituted
"a more or less special problem so far as government encouragement or aid
is concerned." Mail subventions and naval defense requirements might
take care of them. The cost of that to the Government he put at $7,500,000
a year. Add the same amount of "government aid” given to American
cargo vessels in foreign trade and the bill would be $15,000,000. The
"differential" of $4,500 between the operating costs of private American
and British ships might be largely offset, the Admiral intimated, by
"the extremely favorable terms on which American operators can purchase
vessels today.” This seemed to brighten the prospect a good deal, but really
only for a few years, because the time would come when lower British
costs of operation would tell again. The president of the Emergency
Fleet Corporation could not get round those lower British costs and finally
declared: "I want to emphasize the necessity of adopting an adequate
and workable scheme of government aid without much further delay."
He declined to suggest the form. He put that up to Congress, but we may
be sure that Congress will balk when anybody cries subsidy.
A Plan for the Protection of American Shipbuilding
By F. P. Palen, Vice President, Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry
Dock Company, Nautical Gasette, 13 June, 1925.—I think Congress should
protect the shipbuilding industry so the Standard Oil Company and the
United Fruit Company will have their vessels built in the shipyards of the
United States instead of foreign yards, as they are doing at the pres-
ent time.
I have no criticism to make of the action of the Standard Oil Company
and the United Fruit Company in placing their contracts in foreign ship-
yards, as they are doing exactly what I would do under our present laws.
My quarrel is, therefore, with our laws and not with the steamship
owners. Laws which cause American citizens to buy vessels from Krupp's
when at the same time they do not buy machinery or steel from Krupp's are
not just and fair to the shipbuilding industry of the United States.
If the vessels ordered by Americans from foreign yards during the past
two years had been built in the shipyards of this country, this work
would have gone a long way toward keeping the shipyards going.
On the other hand, if Congress does not provide protection for the
industry, which will be sufficient to cause the vessels required by American
owners to be built in the United States, I can see no hope for the industry.
I speak as a disinterested person, as I have no financial interest in any
shipyard.
Congress may think that the machinery and steel industries are of more
national importance than shipbuilding and therefore should be protected,
but in time of war shipbuilding always has been more important and al-
ways will be, so it seems to me that as a matter of national defense as
well as a matter of equity, equal protection should be given to these in-
dustries.
If the President and Congress believe that shipbuilding should be
protected so American citizens can have vessels built in the shipyards of
the United States at a cost as nearly as possible on a parity with the cost
of building them in other countries, then the problem becomes very simple.
There are many ways of protecting the shipbuilding industry to accomplish
this result.

deered.
American owners should be encouraged to build in the United States
shipyards rather than forced to do so, and with this thought in mind I
think the simplest and most direct method of protection will be the best.
I therefore recommend an investment by the government in vessels for
foreign trade equal to the excess cost of building vessels in the United
States, and in return for this investment the United States retain certain
rights in the vessels from which a direct benefit will result, as well as the
indirect benefit resulting from maintaining the industry.
In time of war, the United States has always paid excessive prices for
ships, on account of its shipping policy. In fact, the United States spent,
lost and wasted enough money on account of its shipping policy during the
last war to protect its shipbuilding for the next one hundred years.
I appreciate that the United States has the right to commandeer ves-
sels in time of war, but this right is of no value if there are no vessels
under the American flag that are suitable for its purposes, as was the
case during the Spanish War and World War. We are approaching the
time when obsolete vessels must be replaced. The Standard Oil vessels
and the United Fruit Company vessels, above referred to, will not fly
the American flag, and therefore cannot be commandeered.
If the United States will invest wisely reasonable sums year by year
in vessels operated by American citizens in the foreign trade, it will benefit
and build up its shipyards and shipping and will make available vessels
when needed, at reasonable prices.
I have set forth these thoughts in the form of a bill for presentation to
Congress and I suggest that the shipbuilding industry request the President
and Congress to provide protection sufficient to accomplish the results I have
above outlined.
The bill is as follows:
An Act for Protecting the Shipbuilding Industry of the United States
of America
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled :
Section 1. To provide vessels under the American flag that can be
purchased or chartered at reasonable prices by the United States in time
of war or national emergency; to provide for the purchase and charter of
such vessels by the United States at reasonable prices; to provide for the
replacement of vessels in the foreign trade as they become obsolete; to en-
courage citizens of the United States to build vessels to meet the demands
for the proper growth of our foreign trade, and to maintain a force of
workmen skilled in the art of shipbuilding in the shipyards of the United
States: It is declared the policy of the United States to encourage and
aid its shipbuilding industry sufficiently to cause ships to be built in the
shipyards of the United States for the foreign trade. To accomplish this
end, the United States will acquire an interest in the vessels built under
this Act and will pay a portion of the cost of vessels so built.
Section 2. That the government of the United States shall have the
right in case of war or national emergency to purchase or charter any of
the vessels built under this Act upon the conditions and terms hereinafter
set forth; that in the event a vessel built under the provisions of this Act
is owned or operated in violation of its terms or the flag changed during
the period the United States has an interest therein, the vessel shall be
subject to seizure and sale by the United States and the rights of the
United States as to its interests therein shall take precedence over all
mortgages, claims, liens, etc., against the vessel, and notice to this effect

shall be recorded in the Custom House at the vessel's hailing port and on the
vessel's papers carried on board.
Section 3. That vessels built under this Act shall be owned by citizens
of the United States as provided for in the Merchant Marine Act of 1920;
the vessels shall be of the most modern design and shall be approved by
the United States Shipping Board ; the vessels so built shall not engage
in the coastwise trade of the United States; the price of changes made
during the construction of the vessels, shall be submitted by the owners
to the United States Shipping Board for approval.
Section 4. That there shall be paid from any money in the treasury
not otherwise appropriated, upon the warrant of the Chairman of the
United States Shipping Board and with the approval of a majority of the
members of the Board, to the builders of vessels in the United States who
conform to this Act, a sum not less than 20 per cent or more than 30 per
cent of each and every vessel so built; the Comptroller of the treasury
shall be and he is hereby authorized and directed to make such payments
when duly certified by the chairman of the United States Board; and
the sum of Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) shall be and it is hereby
appropriated for payments to be made on vessels constructed under this
Act; the interest of the United States in a vessel so built shall be de-
preciated at the rate of 5 per cent of the amount paid by the United States,
per annum, and shall cease at the end of twenty years.
Section 5. In the event of a sale and change of the flag of a vessel
built under this Act, before the interest of the United States ceases, the
United States shall be repaid for the interest it holds at the time of sale.
Section 6. That in case of war or national emergency, the United States
shall have the option of purchasing or chartering vessels built under this
Act for a period of twenty years after the date of documentation, on the
following terms:
If the vessel is purchased, the sum to be paid the owner by the United
States shall be the original cost of the vessel to the owner (executive of
the amount paid by the United States to the shipbuilder) less 5 per cent
per annum for depreciation.
If the vessel is chartered, the sum to be paid the owner by the United
States shall be at the rate of 11 per cent of the original cost of the vessel
to the owner (exclusive of the amount paid by the United States to the
shipbuilder), provided that all the costs of operation, maintenance, repairs,
insurance, and so forth are paid by the United States during the charter
period and the vessel is returned to its owner in as good condition as when
chartered, ordinary wear and tear excepted.
It may be noted that the United States can give protection equivalent to
Section Four of the Bill by making loans from the Construction Loan Fund
equal to 50 per cent of the cost of vessels built in the shipyards of the
United States for the foreign trade, without interest, and payable in twenty
equal annual installments.
President Coolidge Requests that Fleet Corporation Conduct
Negotiations for Sale of Ships
Nautical Gazette, 20 June, 1925.— Although the Shipping Board has
displayed greater activity within the past six months in selling govern-
ment tonnage, there have been divisions among the members of the Board
as to the policy to be pursued in the disposition of its ships. The split
in the Board on the sale of the five President liners to R. Stanley Dollar
is still fresh in the minds of the American people, and more recently the

commissioners have been at loggerheads over Chairman O'Connor's in-
dividual efforts to interest Henry Ford in the Government's laid-up ships.
Because the Board does not seem to be able to agree whenever any pro-
posal for the purchase of vessels comes before it, and because it is desirable
that prospective purchasers of government tonnage be afforded every
facility in their negotiations, President Coolidge has taken a hand in the
matter. He has addressed a letter to the Board requesting that the question
of the sales of ships should be left with Admiral Palmer, president of the
Fleet Corporation, that he be given authority to conduct negotiations for
the disposition of tonnage and that the Board keep out of the picture until
the time comes for it to give its final sanction to the deal.
President Coolidge began his letter by referring to revived interest in
the purchase of government ships, and remarked about the difficulties in-
volved in the negotiations of sales contracts.
"I have the strong feeling,” he said, "that such complex negotiations
cannot be competently carried out by the often independent discussions by
buyers with the several members of the Shipping Board. Furthermore,
there is an unwillingness on the part of some of our shipping men to enter
such an involved scene of negotiations.
“In order that we should make a vigorous attempt to carry out the
purpose of the Merchant Marine Act—that is, the disposal of the merchant
marine into private hands-on equitable terms, it seems to me vital that
these negotiations should be placed in one single hand, reserving to the
Shipping Board the final voice in the acceptance or rejection of the
specific contract.
"I would like to suggest to the Board that all negotiations of every
character for the disposal of ships or lines should rest in the hands of
Admiral Palmer, that the members of the Board should refuse to see or
discuss these questions with any individual during the course of such ne-
gotiations; that Admiral Palmer should be authorized to sign contracts
subject to the approval of the board. The Board will then be in a posi-
tion to exercise its proper function in the acceptance or rejection of
the contracts.
"I am convinced that better terms will be secured for the government
and more progress in carrying out the intent of the act than can be
accomplished under the present basis of organization."
It was stated officially at the White House that fear lest difficulties
encountered by prospective purchasers might hamper the disposal of govern-
ment merchant tonnage induced President Coolidge to suggest to the Ship-
ping Board that it turn over to the Emergency Fleet Corporation all
functions connected with the negotiation of ship sales.
That the board leave to the Fleet Corporation the handling of negotia-
tions is as far as the suggestion in the President's letter to the Shipping
Board goes, White House spokesmen added. No other consideration en-
tered into the President's action in proffering his suggestion. It was
indicated that President Coolidge was not dissatisfied with any of the ship
sales recently consummated by the Board and that past transactions had no
connection with the proposal to let President Palmer of the Fleet Corpora-
tion conduct ship sales negotiations in the future.
Mr. Coolidge took action, spokesmen reported, because it was being
constantly called to his attention that people desiring to buy government
vessels were becoming discouraged because of the uncertainty as to whom
they should apply in dealing with a board of seven members.
Purchasers want some one person with whom they can negotiate in-
stead of a board of seven members. Thus, the President was moved to
make his suggestion simply for the convenience of possible buyers.

Spokesmen said that it was the President's idea that Mr. Palmer would
conduct sales negotiations up to the point where a contract of sale could
be presented to the Board for its approval and then the matter would
rest with the Board.
The principal objection voiced to the suggestion made by the President
in the letter to Chairman T. V. O'Connor was that a question of policy is
involved in the sale of services and that the Board could not pass on that
question without having direct contact with prospective purchasers of es-
tablished services. It was pointed out that the Board has to decide whether
or not the purchaser will maintain the established service and that direct
control between the Board and bidders is desirable. Individual ship sales,
not related to established services, have been and are being handled as
the President suggested, the Board merely approving or rejecting sales
negotiated by the Fleet Corporation.
In official circles the President's action is being taken as indicating that
the abolition of the Shipping Board will be included in the Administra-
tion's program for shipping legislation at the next session of Congress and
that President Coolidge is coming round to the view that the merchant
marine problem can best be solved by the concentration of operating func-
tion in the Emergency Fleet Corporation as an independent agency, until
liquidation can be accomplished, and the incorporation of the regulatory
activities of the Shipping Board in the Commerce Department to be di-
rected by an Under Secretary of Merchant Marine.
The President, it is maintained, by stepping into the ship sales situation
at the Board has served notice that he has abandoned the "hands off"
policy which he has observed since the Board's last reported delegation to
the Fleet Corporation of full authority over the fleet.
It is asserted that the President has become more and more dissatisfied
with the state of affairs in the Shipping Board and the difficulty of holding
an independent agency within the lines of administration policies, whereas
the incorporation of the functions of the Board into a department of the
government, under a head responsible to the White House, would greatly
simplify matters.
Abolition of the Shipping Board could be more easily accomplished than
the reorganization of that body since the system of regional representation
now in vogue would make it almost impossible to reduce the membership.
Retention of the Emergency Fleet Corporation would be made necessary
by the fact that its actual function is liquidation and that the operation of
the merchant fleet pending liquidation could not properly come within the
scope of the duties of any of the existing departments.
The suggestion that the functions of the Shipping Board be transferred
to the Department of Commerce met with some opposition in local ship-
ping circles. Captain C. A. McAllister, vice president of the American
Bureau of Shipping, said:
"It would be a fatal mistake to transfer the operation of the govern-
ment ships to the Department of Commerce. It would mean the end of
all constructive effort in behalf of the American merchant marine. The
Shipping Board, with all its shortcomings, is devoting its attention speci-
fically to the interests of the merchant marine. This is a function which
could not be performed by a subordinate of any government department.
"In my opinion, it would be far better to establish a department of
transportation having to do solely with all means of transportation, in-
cluding railroads, airways and shipping, with representation in the Cabinet.
Shipping is just as important to the people of the country as the railroads,
and far too important to be put under control of a bureau of an already
overloaded department."

Problems Confronting American Ships in Foreign Trade
By Leigh C. Palmer, President, Fleet Corporation, Nautical Gazette,
30 May, 1925.–Our merchant fleet comprises two main divisions; that
which is employed in coastwise or domestic trade and that which is engaged
in foreign trade. The former is fully protected by law from the competition
of foreign ships and therefore is on a safe basis similar to that of domestic
industries protected by tariff laws. The latter, that employed in foreign
trade, is entirely unprotected by the government, economically, and is
subject to the keenest competition in a free and open world market.
The coastwise merchant marine may be dismissed from present con-
sideration with the observation that it is a vitally important factor of
our national defense as well as of our domestic transportation system and
must continue to receive the full protection of our Government against the
possible encroachment of cheap foreign ships and cheap labor.
It is our merchant marine in overseas trade that presents our real prob-
lems-problems which apparently are not much nearer a solution today
than they were five or six years ago when our war-created fleet came into
being. But it is these problems that must be solved if the national de-
mand for an adequate and permanent merchant marine is to be satisfied.
And the solution must come soon if we are to avoid further great loss in
public funds and deteriorated ships.
Of the total American tonnage, except tankers, employed in foreign
trade, about 80 per cent is government-owned, for which reason, doubtless,
careless speakers frequently refer to the government fleet as the merchant
marine. As a matter of fact, if the coastwise fleet be taken into con-
sideration, the government-owned portion of the active merchant marine
is only about 40 per cent of the whole. However, the government-owned
fleet may properly be regarded as the controlling element in our merchant
marine in foreign trade and the future of the merchant marine will depend
very largely upon how we shall employ, administer and ultimately dispose
of this fact.
The Fleet Corporation is operating this fleet on the trade routes laid
down to parallel foreign competitors. While there may properly be differ-
ences of opinion as to the necessity of maintaining some of the routes or as
to the details of services on this or that route, it may be said that, on the
whole, the present services conform to American foreign trade require-
ments, which are, first, that our people shall be assured of free and direct
access to all important foreign markets, and second, that our commerce
shall be reasonably protected against discriminatory trade practices and
unnecessarily high freight rates.
Unquestionably, we are maintaining more comprehensive services on
some of the routes than the bare operating results would appear to justify,
but here we must discriminate between the large question of protection of
national trade interests and the less important, though more tangible, one
of ship earnings or losses. Obviously, it is quite impossible to appraise
in terms of dollars the benefits derived from our fleet in the way of in-
creased and improved transportation facilities and their general effects
on our industries and trade, while it is easy to show what these general
benefits have cost us in the way of fleet operating losses.
I think I may safely say that the services at present maintained by the
government are not far different in extent and character from those that
would be maintained by efficient foreign operators if ours were withdrawn
except that we are serving more ports on some of the routes than the trade
warrants. But while our services are appropriate to the trade generally,
they are costing us too much in comparison with those of our competitors.

This brings us to the two principal points of our problem: first, that
American ships are handicapped by a heavy differential in costs, and second,
that American operators are more or less at a disadvantage in being new-
comers into the international shipping game. As for the first point, the
differential can be readily adjusted, at least approximately, as it arises for
the most part from our higher shipbuilding costs, higher wages and other
items of cost in which the price of labor is a factor. This differential, which
for convenience may be called the tangible differential, approximately re-
flects the difference between the price scale, or the standard of living, here
and abroad.
Another, which may be called the intangible differential, arises from
any of the thousand and one things which keep the operator from getting the
cargo and the revenue requisite to success and is also dependent on short-
comings in operating efficiency. He might be highly efficient so far as the
physical operation of ships is concerned and able to keep his expenses low,
but if he is new in the field and lacks knowledge of the intricacies of the
trade, if he lacks efficient traffic agencies at home or abroad, if his reputa-
tion for reliability and good service has not been established, if he lacks
advantageous trade connections, he will not get the necessary cargo and
revenue.
So far as the government-owned fleet is concerned, the intangible dif-
ferential may be diminished very considerably if and when we are able to
turn our lines to private ownership, and thereafter the responsibility and the
careful husbanding that inheres in personal ownership will gradually make
the lines more and more efficient and place them on an even footing
with their foreign competitors. In short, the government should dispose
of its fleet to private ownership as soon as possible without sacrificing
the national interests, not merely for the sake of the direct economies which
would result but for the far more important purpose of placing the merchant
marine on an efficient and permanent basis.
That part of the privately owned merchant marine which is engaged in
overseas trade is probably breaking even, or possibly making a profit in
spite of the handicaps of greater first costs and fixed charges, higher wage
scale, duty on repairs made abroad, and other disadvantages as compared
with foreign competitors.
This, however, does not apply to any great number of vessels in foreign
trade and could not properly be used as an argument that aid is not neces-
sary to overcome the differential. It applies to a few so-called industrial
carriers who, in addition to basic cargoes from home ports, are able through
their world-wide business connections and through their own requirements
for raw products from abroad and through their business-like cooperation
in giving foreign competitors some of their outgoing business, to get good
cargoes homeward as well as outward. Such organizations are the nucleus
of the privately owned American merchant marine, and if our ships could be
sold into like capable hands the future of the merchant marine would be
assured.
The greater part of the overseas merchant marine, that part which is
owned by the government and operated through managing agents, is losing
heavily though the average losses are much less than they were a year
ago. I think it is well to try to clear the atmosphere and show just why
we are losing money while our foreign competitors and private American
operators are breaking even or making small profits. We can place on
one side those losses for which our own people are responsible and which
can be corrected, and on the other side those which are beyond the power
of our operators to remedy. For these losses beyond the operators' power
to remedy, some kind of assistance will have to be given if the merchant

marine is to be on an equal competitive basis with foreigners; unless it is
on an equal competitive basis, it cannot endure. The losses for which the
operators are responsible can be reduced and ultimately avoided almost en-
tirely through increased experience together with strict economy-in other
words, high efficiency. I am not recommending at this time any particular
kind of assistance; that is a matter open to wide differences of opinion. But
I wish to show just where the differences exist between our own and for-
eign operating results.
I have already referred to tangible and intangible differentials. The
tangible handicaps are higher fixed charges covering interest, depreciation
and insurance, which are due directly to the higher cost of ship construc-
tion in America; higher crew cost, that is, wages and subsistence, due
to the higher cost of labor and the higher scale of living in our country;
and the higher cost of repairs and of administration due to the higher price
level of rents, service and personnel.
The handicap of high fixed charges, however, is almost negligible at the
present time for the reason that ship values the world over have been
marked down to about a common level; but it will become of great im-
portance when it becomes necessary for American lines to replace existing
tonnage with new and improved vessels. Vessels built in American ship-
yards cost approximately 25 per cent more than similar vessels built in Great
Britain, and in this connection it is interesting to note that British vessels
in turn are now costing considerably more than vessels built in Germany
and some other European countries. Since interest, depreciation and in-
surance are proportional to vessel values, and as these charges combined
amount to about 15 per cent per annum, it will be realized that our higher
fixed charges on new vessels will be a very serious handicap.
Our wage costs are considerably higher than the British and nearly 100
per cent more than those of certain other countries.
Our higher cost of administration, commonly referred to as overhead, is
not easily evaluated since conditions vary greatly among American organ-
izations and, of course, foreign costs are difficult to ascertain, but it is
probable that the difference is nearly proportional to the difference in the
general price levels here and abroad.
To give concrete form to these items, we may assume that the average
results of a certain government-controlled line shows an operating loss of
$15,000 per voyage while a foreign line of similar ships in the same trade
is breaking even. The tangible differential against our ships will be as-
sumed to comprise the following items :
Higher wages
........$3,400
Higher cost of food, stores and equipment ............ 1,600
Higher cost of repairs ...........
...... 1,500
Higher administrative expense ...
..
1,200
Total
..........$7,700
If the foreign ships are breaking even while ours are losing $15,000, and
if the tangible differential accounts for only $7,700 of this, the remaining
$7,300 is the intangible differential attribute to more efficient operation of
the foreign line as compared with our government-controlled line.
This tangible differential may include:
Inexperience or inefficiency of the operator and his personnel, including
ships' crews, which is reflected in insufficient revenue, and in high operating
costs in general.
Inadequate traffic organization at home and abroad and consequent in-
ability to secure a due share of the traffic.

Lack of basic cargo, due to a lack of favorable business connections at
home and abroad.
Comparative absence of the favoring spirit or good will, due to recent
appearance in the field; unproved reliability, or lack of established repu-
tation; and the more or less common view held by shippers that the service
is of an emergency or temporary character.
Unfavorable or discriminatory United States laws.
Covering more ports than economic conditions justify.
On this assumption it is seen that about half of the present differential
between our own and foreign operating costs is attributable to intangibles
which can be corrected in large part or abolished, and that the other half
represents the actual excess cost of our operation over that of competing
foreign vessels. By elimination of uneconomic ports and better turn-around
a private American operator might reduce the tangible differential by
one-third.
Certain private American lines apparently are operating their vessels
in overseas trade at a profit, or at least without loss. They probably
are not handicapped by the above-mentioned intangible differentials; in other
words, they have highly efficient organizations. They have, however, the
tangible differential of high wages, and so forth, to contend with, and no
doubt are able to carry that differential by reason of their favorable and ex-
clusive relations with other interests which furnish profitable cargoes.
With high-priced ships and labor we cannot expect to compete success-
fully with cheap ships and cheap labor on all the ocean highways; but
there are some routes on which American ships are not seriously handi-
capped by higher operating costs and in which American lines with ad-
vantageous industrial and shipping connections might, and probably will, be
able to maintain themselves against any competition. Indeed, the best
prospects for the further development of our merchant marine on the over-
sea routes appear to lie in the establishment of lines by strong industrial
concerns for the carriage of their own supplies and products and for com-
mon service. Another prospect lies in our railroads becoming interested in
extending their transportation systems to foreign shores through ownership
of, or affiliation with, steamship lines. Obviously, a line which is assured
basic cargoes for its vessels is in a far more favorable position than one
which has to compete for every ton of cargo it gets.
The Fleet Corporation is following consistently the President's well-
known policy of efficient economy in public expenditures. We have greatly
curtained our operating losses during the past year. We shall not be
satisfied as long as our losses are greater than those which can properly
be accounted for as the unavoidable differential between the cost of public
and private American operation of the necessary services.
In the matter of administrative expenses, the annual payroll has been
reduced during the last four months more than a million dollars through
the elimination of unnecessary personnel. However, the prospect for
the greatest improvement lies in the further reduction of vessel operating
expense and the building up of revenues. While the recent decrease in
yearly losses is a great stride forward, it is only a start toward placing
the government fleet on a near-business basis and making it possible
eventually to dispose of our lines to private owners as contemplated by
the Merchant Marine Act.
During the last sixteen months we have been clearing ground. We have
reduced our losses from $50,000,000 to $36,000,000 a year, although handling
the same amount of business and in July two months from today, we will
be operating at a loss of but $28,000,000 a year.
I don't want to mislead myself nor do I want to mislead anyone else into
the idea of thinking that the reduction in the cost of operating the Fleet

Corporation, say from $50,000,000 down to $28,000,000, bear any real rela-
tion to the advance that is being made toward solving our merchant marine
problems. Although this very great reduction in losses, $22,000,000 out of
$50,000,000, will have great weight in getting our services on a more busi-
ness like basis, yet we must not for a moment believe that the progress
toward solving the problems of the merchant marine is proportional to these
figures. The increase in efficiency presented by these figures is of value in
clearing the ground so that the real vital problems of how we are going
to keep the merchant marine on the seas can be taken up. The thought
I want to convey is that in spite of all the increased economy and efficiency
of the Fleet Corporation in the last sixteen months, no real constructive
measure has been adopted by the country to keep our merchant flag per-
manently on the sea.
There is serious doubt as to whether the subsidy principle can be reha-
bilitated in our country. But it has been suggested that while a general, or
blanket, aid applicable to all routes regardless of local or peculiar condi-
tions might be unacceptable, special assistance for the establishment and
maintenance of particular services might well be regarded as proper and
acceptable. For example, if to further a national policy, it were desired
to bring our country into closer relationship with another through im-
proved communication and transportation facilities and give our producers,
exporters and importers an oportunity to develop trade in a new field, it
might be well that public opinion would find it desirable to subsidize a line
that would provide the desired service. The mail subvention or other
form of subsidy has been applied by practically all great maritime powers
for such special purposes.
Usually this form of government aid has been identified with matters
of national defense, the purpose being in part the creation of vessels of
a type desired for war purposes. It has not been applied to cargo vessels
to any considerable extent; but there is no reason why it should not be so
applied if a cargo service is needed to meet a particular national trade
necessity.
Defense of Merchant Ships in A Future War
Journal of the Royal United Service Institution, May, 1925.—In the
various Service publications for the past several years much has been
written about the future of the fighting Services on land and sea, and in
the air, but little attention seems to be paid to the defense of our merchant
ships in another war. Before going deeper into this subject, I would remind
the reader that the fighting Services depend entirely upon these ships for
their maintenance in consumable stores and for sea transport of every
description.
One of the greatest lessons potential enemies can have learnt from the
history of the last war is that a speedy destruction of our merchant ships
would ensure victory over the British Empire. Unlike the main fighting
feet of the Royal Navy, merchant ships must keep the seas, day after
day, in order to maintain both the civil population and the fighting forces.
In view of the great advance of air warfare the system of convoys at
sea, as practiced in the late war, will have to be improved upon. The
offensively armed escort will, in fact, have to be able to meet air attacks
in addition to fighting surface and underwater craft. Merchant ships,
too, will have to be able to defend themselves against (a) underwater
attack, (b) aerial attack, (c) gas attack. It is also suggested that they
should be trained to combine and act together so as to make full use of
their limited primary armament against a single raider. The three or
four simple formations required to place the ships in such order as to

bring their most effective fire to bear on the enemy could be learned by
any mariner in a few hours.
The young officers who were watchkeepers in our convoys in 1916-18
will most probably be ship masters in the next war, so that the art of
handling ships in unison and station keeping will no longer be looked upon
as a sort of black magic.
The masters and mates of our merchant ships should be taught in peace
how to prepare their ships for time of war. The measures to be taken
should be included in the curriculum of the marine schools and training
establishments in general.
If officers were trained in this way there would be less danger of a
repetition of many regrettable losses which occured in 1914-18.
The Board of Trade could issue printed instructions to the local marine
board, who in turn could inform the navigation schools at the various
ports; thus the aspirants for a board of trade certificate would have at
least a working knowledge of how to safeguard their ships in wartime.
With regard to the use of the defensive armament of merchant ships,
I have before me a letter, written in September, 1913, dealing with the
subject of training merchant service officers in the use of light guns
(3-pdr. to 6-in.). In the letter it was suggested to make the board of
trade certificate provisional until the officer had qualified in elementary
gunnery knowledge. The treasury was, I think, the stumbling-block, and
nothing happened until the war came-in fact, till 1915 and onwards.
The result was merchant ships were manned by a few half-trained gun-
layers and breach-workers, and the other members of the gun's crew
were picked up from the ship's personnel, who probably had never seen
the type of gun they were called upon to work, and yet might have to
deal with an enemy within four hours of clearing the dock gates.
The training of officers in the use of merchant ships' armaments should
not be neglected in peace time. It could be a voluntary nature and might
be carried out by the instructors of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve
who are stationed in all our great ports.
Shipping companies would, I think, cooperate in the scheme by giving
preference to the young men who are in possession of certificates of knowl.
edge of armaments by sending them to defensively armed ships.
Turning to questions of matériel, in order to provide for future con-
tingencies, before the perils of war are upon us, I suggest the following
should be done:
1. Give all merchant ships of from 2,500 to 6,000 tons net one anti-
aircraft gun; this gun to be so mounted that it could be used either for
high angle or as part of the ship's ordinary armament, to which it should
be an addition.
2. Ships of over 6,000 tons net to have an additional armament of two
H.A, guns similarly mounted.
3. Gas masks to be supplied to every member of all merchant ships'
complements.
With regard to the latter, the obsolete pattern of gas mask could be used
for the protection of mercantile personnel, with the exception of the people
who are called upon to perform hard physical labor on the upper deck, or
in the stokehold of coal-burning ships. For the latter the improved pattern
is necessary, as men cannot do heavy work efficiently in the older pattern
of mask.
The care and maintenance of anti-gas equipment for the Mercantile
Marine in peace time is a subject which calls for the close cooperation of
the Admiralty and the shipping companies throughout the Empire.

It is a bold man who will say gas attack at sea from aircraft is a most
unlikely method of attacking our merchant shipping. In the opinion of the
present writer the day is near when chemists and research workers will
produce a gas which can be controlled and regulated according to the
barometer and thermometer readings.
It is not unlikely that, within the next decade, it will be possible for an
enemy to spread a high concentration of gas at a selected level above the
water and distributed over, perhaps, ten square miles of sea. A convoy
harassed on both flanks by a flight of aircraft may be driven into this in-
fected area, when an untrained and unprotected crew will soon be out of
action. On the other hand, a ship which is manned and armed with trained
men and more or less adequate weapons of offence and defence could at
least have more than an equal chance of destroying (not merely evading)
the enemy.
Up to a hundred twenty years ago, all merchant ships were, for their
day, well armed and able to look after themselves. It would be well if we
reverted to the practice of our forebears in this respect and placed our
"common carriers," upon whom the existence of our Empire depends in
peace and war, in a position to defend themselves against the enemy. At
present we are being lulled into a false sense of security by writers of
pretty poems about the sea and pacifists who talk of there being no more
war, until we shall find, when the time comes, that our merchant ships are
just about as capable of defending themselves against these new forms of
attack as sitting ducks on a Norfolk Broad are against the punt gunner.
ENGINEERING
Rival Methods of Ship Propulsion
Engineering, 12 June, 1925.-In a multitude of counselors there may
perchance be wisdom, but there is certainly confusion, so that the
plain man perplexed by opposing opinions is prone to pursue the prudent
policy of Mr. Pickwick at Eatonswill, and to join in the shouts of the largest
mob. There are, in fact, fashions in engineering, as well as in feminine
modes. The building of the Forth Bridge set every structural engineer
talking of cantilevers, with the result that a number of bridges were erected
on this system which might better have been built to other plans. The
successful construction of the City of South London Tube similarly led
to the unnecessary use of shields for other tunnels, and there is a distinct
possibility that the great attention now being paid to the internal combustion
marine engine, may give rise to the adoption of the type in instances where
the superiority really lies with steam. Of course, there are cases in
which one or another of the competing systems has such marked advantages.
that rivalry is impossible. The steam launch cannot compete with the high-
speed motor launch, nor is the internal combustion engine suitable for cross-
channel packets. In the navy, again, it would have been impossible to drive
the Hood with internal combustion engines, and, in fact, in all vessels requir-
ing very large powers, the internal combustion engine is as out of place as it
is in large land power stations. Moreover, in naval service, the "elasticity"
of steam has some advantages. At the battle of the Falkland Islands, it
will be remembered that the steam-driven Kent completely beat her trial
trip record. This feat was the more remarkable in that the Kent had
reciprocating engines, which have less flexibility than the steam turbine.
In the merchant service, there is not the same demand for flexibility,
and the low overload capacity of the Diesel engine is here of but minor
importance, while its unquestionable superiority in thermal efficiency is a
strong argument in favor of its extended use. The question is, however,
by no means so simple as is sometimes assumed. In a letter to the Times
Lord Bearsted, for example, quotes a Birmingham professor as responsible

for the statement that "the oil engine will remain the most economical type
of heat engine in existence." Such a remark if not attributed to confusion
of thought, is at least open to the charge of carelessness of expression.
It is by no means established that the internal combustion marine engine
is the most economical of heat engines, and, in fact, Sir Charles Parsons
has declared himself ready to guarantee as high an economy with steam
as the best recorded with the marine Diesel Engine.
In short, the term economy and efficiency cannot be regarded as synony-
mous. In efficiency no heat engine can even begin to compare with an
electric motor taking its current from a primary battery. The chemical
energy of the "fuel" consumed in the latter can be converted into useful
work with less than 5 per cent of loss, while with the Diesel engine, high
as its efficiency is, the loss is fully 60 per cent. Nevertheless, although the
suggested combination of battery and electric motor is highly efficient, it is
by no means economical. The cost of the fuel has to be considered, in
addition to the efficiency with which it can be converted into useful energy,
and the protagonists of steam maintain that with current prices of Diesel
oil and fuel oil, power can be obtained with steam at a cost not greater
than if it were generated by Diesel engines.
In a pamphlet recently published, the Parsons' Marine Steam Turbine
Company give some further details of the plant which Sir Charles Parsons
had apparently in mind when taking part in the recent discussion at the
Institution of Naval Architects-a debate, by the by, in which little share
was taken by the advocates of the Diesel engine. The proposals of the
Parsons' Marine Steam Turbine Company have reference to a 14-knot
vessel, engaged on a voyage of 6,000 miles, and fitted with turbines generat-
ing 5,000 shaft horsepower.
A steam pressure of 500 lbs. per square inch is specified, combined
with superheating to 700° F., water tube boilers being used. Several boiler
makers it may be observed, are prepared to guarantee the performance of
boilers of this type at the pressure and temperature named. There would be
three turbines in series, of which the high pressure is designed to run at
5,000 r.p.m., the intermediate at 3,000, and the low pressure at 1,700 r.p.m.
These speeds would be reduced by double-reduction gearing to 90 r.p.m.
at the propeller shaft. A total consumption for all purposes of 0.66 lbs. of
oil per shaft horsepower is guaranteed, and it must be remembered in this
connection, that the guarantees of Sir Charles Parsons commonly hold
good; a rule which, unfortunately, is not observed by all turbine builders.
One notorious Continental firm, for example, is reported to have been 10
per cent to 14 per cent worse than its guarantees in the case of one very
large plant erected by them since the war. The 0.66 lbs. of oil will, it is
claimed, cost no more than the 0.45 lbs. which would be taken "for all
purposes," by a corresponding Diesel engine plant, and, moreover, the steam
plant would have the option of using coal, the guarantee for which "for all
purposes” is 0.98 lbs. per shaft horsepower.
These figures show how far marine engineers have of late years lagged
behind in the development of steam-driven plants. In the past it was the
marine engineer who was mainly responsible for the popularisation of triple
expansion engines and of what used to be considered high-pressure steam.
This was probably due to the fact that powers at sea ruled larger than on
land, and a more skilled engine-room staff was employed at sea than was
customary in land service. Today conditions are reversed, 5,000 h.p. repre-
sents a fair-sized marine installation, while a unit of this output would
be regarded as small in a land power station.
The outcome of the contest between the two rival methods of ship pro-
pulsion will, on the one hand, turn upon the possibility of improving the

1545

thermal efficiency of the steam plant and on the other the possibility of
reducing the cost and weight of Diesel machinery. As matters stand, the
best types of turbine can hardly be improved mechanically, but its average
thermal efficiency at sea can certainly be considerably increased. On the
other hand, there seems little prospect of any material increase in the
thermal efficiency of the Diesel engine, but its weight and cost ought to
be capable of reduction. This may involve an increase in rotational speeds,
and it is possible that this may revive some of the engine-room troubles
which vanished on the introduction of the turbine. Destroyer trials were
a serious anxiety to the builders of reciprocating engines, and there were
several disastrous accidents from connecting rod fractures. No doubt a
smash of this kind would be a much less serious matter with a Diesel
engine than it was with steam, where the whole engine room complement ran
the risk of being scalded to death. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that
high speed reciprocating machinery is more subject to fracture than that in
which the motion is purely rotary, and considerable circumspection will be
required in improving the Diesel engine along this line of advance. No
doubt the difficulties can be overcome, and it is not a little extraordinary
that certain motor bicycle and small motor car engines attain 3,000 r.p.m.-
a speed which at the beginning of the century was considered too high for
turbines of more than some 500 kw. rating.
From the purely academic standpoint, there is certainly something very
attractive in the idea of a prime mover complete in itself. With steam
the fuel is burnt in one component of the plant, and the useful work pro-
duced in another, while in the internal combustion engine the conversion
of the chemical energy of the fuel into power is effected in a single unit.
Short cuts of this kind are alluring, but experience has shown that in
many departments of industry the short cut is not always preferable to the
longer way round. In the Catalan forge, iron was made directly from the
ore, but no great development of iron and steel manufacture was possible
until a much more complicated method of reduction was elaborated, and this
experience has been parallel in other trades. Simple and direct processes
generally imply the use of "raw materials” of somewhat exceptional quality,
and though builders often claim that the Diesel engine can be run on
indifferent oils, these are not in favor with users. In this lies the possibility
of the successful competition of steam with the marine Diesel engine, and
the advantage which it has in this regard may be increased if certain modern
methods of using coal be extended to sea service. At one American power
station it is reported that the boiler room is furnished like an office. All
grime and dust are excluded, and the coal is handled and used with as
little trouble or nuisance as oil, the boiler room crew being reduced to a
mere skeleton of what was formerly required.
It is on this question of fuel costs, direct and indirect, that the contest
for supremacy will ultimately turn, and on this head the last word on behalf
of steam has still to be said. In the matter of reliability, the Diesel engine
appears now to be satisfactory. The testimony in this respect of Mr. Ruck-
Keene, Chief Engineer-Surveyor of Lloyds, given in the discussion at the
Institution of Naval Architects, may fairly be regarded as authoritative.
He declared that in the actual operation of Diesel ships the adjustments
which had to be made to the propelling plant were far fewer than was the
case with steam.
Both the rival types of prime mover are handicapped by the demand of
the propeller for a low rate of revolution, and any considerable diminution
in the weight of the Diesel engine would probably involve such an increase
in the rotational speed as to render necessary the introduction of gearing
between the crank shaft and the propeller shaft.

MISCELLANEOUS
Limitations of Modern Sea War
By Sir Herbert Russell, Naval and Military Record, 27 May, 1925. -
The recent death of Admiral-of-the-Fleet Sir Doveton Sturdee naturally
evoked general reference to the victor of the Falklands," and his place in
naval history will always be earmarked by that brilliant achievement. But,
it produced singularly little evidence of any realization of the fact that
this was the one—and perhaps the only one-really great strategical feat of
the British Navy during the Great War. In saying this, let me hasten to
add a disclaimer of any suggestion that the strategical ability of the British
Navy gave any manifestation of failure. It was simply that the modern
conditions of sea warfare denied to it opportunity for displaying itself.
Granted that the original disposition of the fleet to its war station was a
step of first-rate strategical skill, when this had been accomplished the naval
war, in its major dimensions, was virtually reduced to stalemate.
It is certainly legitimate to class the drive into Heligoland Bight and the
Battle of the Doggerbank as operations of a strategical order, but I cannot
believe that any competent student of war would admit either to be in
the category of great strategical achievements.
The battle off the Falklands certainly comes within the scope of this
definition. It was a great conception, and conception is the very essence of
strategy. With unerring sagacity it assumed the next move on the part
of the enemy after his decisive success off Cape Coromel, and calculated
to a nicety how to counter that move. The result was a success of very
real material importance, and of immense moral and political value. Thus
the word strategy was exemplified in its fullest and widest application. Of
course, from the moment that Admiral Von Spee's ships came within sight
of Port Stanley the strategical aspect was finished and the tactical phase
began. The German Admiral, outclassed in every combatant point, showed
his own tactical skill in the course that he took. So long as he was able
to continue fighting his one endeavor was to close the range. If he could
only bring his 8-inch batteries within effective striking distance of his
attackers, the tremendous advantage of their 12-inch guns might in a con-
siderable measure be neutralized. The story of the conflict is too familiar
to bear retelling, but it will always remain a very notable action as a
perfect example of the dual qualities or strategy and tactics.
The only strategical element about the Battle of Jutland lay in the fact
that the grand fleet was permanently posted in such a commanding position
as to enable it to force action in the event of the high seas fleet venturing
any distance from its base. But the fight was not the result of any definite
preconception. The battle cruiser squadrons were not sent to sea in any
expectation of drawing Admiral Sheer out of the Jade. Admiral Jellicoe
had worked out various alternative tactical plans to be followed in the event
of a general action according to the circumstances in which the clash might
take place, but he never evolved any strategical scheme for attempting to
force an issue.
Indeed, as far as we know, Admiral Jellicoe opposed (and probably
rightly so) such strategical schemes as were proposed for the employment
of the grand feet. Lord Fisher had a great idea of a "Baltic gamble" which
was entily strategical. It was a conception fraught with unlimited possi-
bilities, but likewise beset too much with the element of a gamble to
commend itself to a less imaginative and more prudent commander. Fisher
was a man of obsessions, who stood for the doctrine of not counting risks.
To have launched a sufficient force into the Baltic to justify expectation
of decisive results would have been to unchain the high seas feet, which

might have followed the grand fleet through the Great Belt-or might have
done something unexpected and very much more mischievous.
The answer to the lack of strategical opportunity during the Great War
is that the art of strategy consists in making opportunity. But this is a
species of textbook precept which calls for a good deal of qualification.
There are more ways than one of catching a sdre, but if the hare goes to
ground behind barbed wire and man-traps, then, as Mrs. Glass implies, the
soup must go unmade. Strategy dictates that, in these conditions, it is
wiser to surround the hare and keep him where he is than to run the in-
calculable risk of digging him out, for negative strategy may be even
greater than positive strategy, as Wellington taught the French at Torres
Vedras.
Strategy made its opportunity at the Falkland Islands, because the
opportunity was there to be made, but in view of the experiences of the
naval war it is scarcely surprising to find a plea for a new and wider
definition of the word than is embraced in its traditional acceptance. This
plea has but one defect to my mind; it threatens to complicate the study
of war itself. It is rather like demanding that a mathematical student, who
is set to work out the cubic dimensions of a body, shall likewise know all
about the matter of which that body is composed.
Admiral Sir Reginald Custance, in his masterly exposition of A Study
of War, suggests that lack of a sufficiently wide perception of the meaning
of strategy is responsible for some confusion of thought in the writings of
Mahan. He quotes, by way of example, the doctrine laid down by Mahan
that “The aim of naval strategy is to get command of the sea. ... which
means control of communications”; and he objects that in this the political
object only is indicated-security and the control of communications. Sir
Reginald Custance argues that the military aim finds no place in this
definition of strategy; neither the enemy fleet nor the idea of decision by
battle are referred to.
But, is it not possible that Mahan presupposes the military aim to have
been accomplished in the realization of the conditions he implies? He says
that the aim of naval strategy is to get command of the sea and control of
communications. Surely this aim can never be accomplished so long as the
enemy fleet remains undefeated? Can it be maintained that we succeeded in
establishing command of the sea or control of communications throughout
the Great War? All strategical conception was baffled by the elusiveness
of modern conditions of naval warfare, and in consequence the military aim
remained unaccomplished. This being so, Mahan's definition of strategy
was never attained. With profound respect, I still remain to be convinced
that it is a faulty definition on this account, or that it shows any confusion
of ideas.
On the other hand, the student of war who takes Mahan's interpretation
of strategy as sufficiently comprehensive clears his mental vision to specific
perception. He is dealing with naval war. He need not refer at all to the
polital atmosphere or the political aspect in order to master the military
aim.
Politics certainly enter directly into strategy when the politicians butt-in
upon the military conception. Admiral Sir Berkeley Milne was a victim
of a striking example of this, and Mr. Churchill's conflicting anxieties not
to touch the susceptibilities of Italy, and at the same time nof, to let the
Goeben and Breslau escape resulted, as such interference inevi:ably must,
in their escaping quite comfortably, and giving Mr. Churchill still bigger
opportunities for interference by plunging us into war with Turkey.
It is merely admitting the obvious to say there could be no military
strategy without the political aim, because war is simply the attempt to

enforce the political aim. But the strategy of war begins when the
diplomacy of politics has failed. Napoleon was a consumerate strategist
and a great politician; the genius which made the one ensured the other,
but when we study the story of Austerlitz or Marengo we are studying
strategy in its heretofore fully accepted meaning, and the colossal ambition
which led up to these battles has no more to do with the actual strategy of
the battles than the Potsdam heroics of the ex-Kaiser had to do with the
breakaway of the German fleet at Jutland.
Will the Capital Ship Pass?
By Sir Herbert Russell, Naval and Military Record, 20 June, 1925.-
To lay down, however tentatively, any precept which seems to violate an
immemorial principle is naturally to challenge dissent. Loyalty to tradition
is an admirable quality, but occasionally it is apt to be a little unreasoning.
The attitude of the Admiralty towards the adoption of steam and iron
is a classic example. I confess to sympathy in that spirit of dogged con-
servatism. I would rather look upon a three-decker under full sail than
a super-Dreadnaught under full steam. I would rather watch a squad of
hearties drilling with boarding pikes than look on at the smartest exercises
in a 15-inch gun turret.
But what is the good ? Science is an inexorable Frankenstien, and,
having unchained him, we are not going to arrest his progress by lamenting
what he has destroyed. We may occasionally ask questions as to the trend
of his steps. I am about to ask one now. The foregoing conclusion that
a great many people will dismiss it as not a matter for argument at all
does not in the least deter me. It is not even a new question, for we have
heard it a good many times since the war, although not put in the same
sense as I am asking it. In short, as Mr. Micawber would have said, what
is the use of the battleship?
The late Admiral Sir Percy Scott raised this same point entirely on the
grounds of combatant value. His view was that new methods of naval
warfare have beset the capital ship with so many menacing restrictions as to
largely reduce her to impotence. At one time he carried a large body of
opinion with him. I believe that this has steadily dwindled to almost
negligible dimensions. Of course, I need hardly add that I am speaking of
qualified opinion. Our old friend, the man in the street, may well be
pardoned for agreeing, that bombs from above, or torpedoes from beneath,
are going to demolish and surface ship. Probably he secretly wonders how
thirty thousands tons of iron can be got to float at all.
But I believe Captain Max Horton merely spoke the simple truth when
he recently stated that the battleship "is on a firmer basis" than she was
during the war. Her powers of resistance have immensely increased; the
antidotes to the new forms of menace have been steadily and successfully
developed; the new forms of menace have made little, if any, relative
progress. The enormous expenditure of ammunition and the great length
of time which it took to sink the British Monarch and the United States
Washington—both absolutely passive targets-afford a pretty striking illus-
tration of the resisting endurance of the modern armored ship. And pro-
gress toward invulnerability has been carried a long stage further than in
either of these vessels.
Therefore, I think we may definitely reject the premise of Sir Percy
Scott that the battleship is of "no damned use" because she can no longer
adequately defend herself. So far from any prospect of her being driven
off the face of the sea by new methods of warfare, she is considerably better
able to take her own part today than she was ten years ago. Indeed, I

preface my question with the admission that the battleship of today is
quite equal to continuing the functions of the ship-of-the-line of a century
ago. As a weapon, in fact, she still remains effective in the highest degree.
But I submit that the value of any weapon, however formidable in itself,
is conditional upon one obvious factor: the opportunity for employing it.
And this is where it seems to me that the battleship has lost her potential
position. The Battle of Tsushima won the naval war for Japan. It marked
the beginning of the Dreadnaught era. In this respect it was a most un-
fortunate "lesson." Japan possessed a superiority of weapons, and her
enemy afforded her an opportunity to use them. The Dreadnaught doctrine
presupposed that such opportunity would always be assured. It simply
meant the policy of building ships to beat the enemy by virtue of being
bigger, and faster, and altogether more formidable than anything he pro-
duced. It marked the very apotheosis of the material school.
The Great War very soon revealed the fact that Germany intended to
deny us opportunity for activity employing our superiority in capital ship
strength. With commendable strategic foresight the grand feet had been
concentrated in its pre-arranged war station before hostilities commenced.
By this initial advantage it was assured that the high seas fleet could only
come forth, to any purpose whatever, on the terms of accepting battle.
During the early days of the great struggle expectation was on the very
tiptoe. The nation was eagerly awaiting the grand clash of the great
armadas. Then, as perception grew that the German Grand Admiral was
steadfastly declining any such clash, a murmur arose to go and "ferret the
rats out of their lair." A good deal was said, and more still was written,
about what Nelson would have done. The Battle of Azoukir was held up as
a splendid precedent for dealing with such a situation. In fact, an extra-
ordinary amount of heroic nonsense was talked and written, for even yet
the radical difference in the conditions of naval warfare between Nelson's
time and Jellico's time had not soaked into the national understanding.
Our grand fleet battleships used their guns in action against the enemy
once during four years. And even this occasion was the result of a mis-
conception on the part of Admiral Scheer, who never had the least intention
of a grand clash with Jellicoe's forces. For four long years, with this
solitary unintended exception, the two most powerful fleets the world has
ever seen sat and watched one another. And meanwhile, beyond the ring
they kept, the sea conflict was waged furiously, and for this country rather
disastrously.
There are plenty of academic-minded students of naval warfare who
either have already treated us, or are quite prepared to treat us, to crudite
demonstrations of the influence of this passive phase upon the course of
the whole, stupendous struggle. They allege that we neutralized the sea
power of Germany. I allege that we did nothing of the sort. When the
German Navy was sinking our battleships in the Dardanelles, when it was
bombarding the port of Liberia, and later on, a lighthouse on the American
coast, when it was scattering the western approaches and the narrow seas
with the cargoes that we so urgently needed, can we say that it was
neutralized"?
We dealt with this new form of war, dealt with it magnificently and
with growing success, but not by virtue of our mighty line-of-battle. In-
deed, the grand fleet proved a positive handicap to commerce protection,
since it retained large numbers of cruisers and destroyers at Scapa which
would have been of the utmost value in the campaign against U boats. Of
course, it could not be helped. There was nothing else that could be done.
The Germans condemned our capital fleet to uselessness in keeping its own
useless. We exercised the "silent pressure" about which the late Admiral

Mahan wrote so brilliantly. But, when Mahan was writing, more than three
decades ago, there were no means of getting under and past "silent
pressure”; now the phrase has become an anachronism.
Suppose that neither Germany nor ourselves had possessed any battleships
at all, is it not quite conceivable that we should have got on with the naval
war more quickly and more decisively? It is not true to say that the same
thing might equally be asked of any other type of warcraft. All the other
types of warcraft were actively busy. The capital ships alone (with the
exception of the battle cruisers, which assumed the role formerly filled by
legitimate cruisers) played a negative part. The real value we got out of
our superb grand fleet was that it denied to Germany the possibility of
using her fine high seas fleet. We wanted her to use it from the very time
of taking up our war station, but it was quite impossible to force her into
using it.
What is the use of the battleship? To fight the enemy's battleship. But
suppose the enemy battleship will not come out and fight. In Nelson's day
the remedy for this lay in the close blockade. Such a procedure is out of
the question in this age of submarines and destroyers, of aircraft and mines,
and of artillery possibilities such as were exhibited when the Germans
bombarded Paris from a range of seventy miles. Moreover, why closely
blockade an enemy who has already quite made up his mind to lie snug
behind defenses which it would be altogether too hazardous for any battle
fleet to attempt to force?
The weapons of war have been evolved by the conditions of war. The
conditions of war at sea changed but little from the time of the Spanish
armada until the final disappearance of sail power. The battleship per-
petuates the conditions, but in defiance of the changes which have so re-
stricted her opportunity for fulfilling them. Jutland proved that a great fleet
action can never be the compact and decisive affair it formerly was. The
chemical element is going to add another very confusing factor to the
existing disabilities of open-sea combat. How far that factor may be de-
veloped it is impossible to foresee. The Germans are reported to have
carried out many experiments with rainbow smoke screens during their late
naval maneuvers, the idea being to render effective long-range shooting
impracticable.
When the Rodney and Nelson are completed none of the great sea powers
will be at liberty to lay down any more capital ships (presuming the Wash-
ington Agreement continues to be observed) for several years to come, with
the exception of France, which appears to favor a type of very small and
very mobile battle cruiser, more analogous to an armored cruiser than a
present-day capital ship. During this period there will be considerable
activity in the construction of very fast, sea-keeping cruisers, of 10,000 tons,
armed with 8-inch guns of very high velocity and great range. These
vessels seem to me to embody the latest principles of modern sea warfare:
the capacity to either devastate or protect commerce. They are units of
independent action, as distinct from the merely component function of the
ship-of-the-line. Four of them can be produced for the cost of one
capital ship. Economicaliy, therefore, they are a much preferable weapon.
It is self-evident that they cannot do what the capital ship is designed to
do. But if it be a resonable contention that the capital ship is likely to be
denied much opportunity of fulfilling her designed purpose--at any rate,
actively--then surely this advantage is more apparent than real.
War has one single purpose: the reduction of the enemy to submission.
All the methods and weapons of war are a means to this end. In spite of
our overwhelming strength in ships-in-the-line, and the exceptional advan-
tages of strategic position for the employment of this strength, the

Germans at sea came dangerously near to reducing us to capitulation.
This is the aspect of naval war which we have to face in the future. Prey-
ing upon commerce has always been a feature of sea warfare, but the old
privateer was a very different sort of foe from the modern submarine.
Steadily we become less and less a country of internal resources. The pros-
pect of starvation was never really an imminent menace during the great sea
wars of the past. It certainly was in the years 1916-18.
The capital ship is kept alive by rivalry. It is impossible for one power
to abandon her unless all the rest do. Competition frequently results in
confusion of thought. The great naval nations go on evolving the most
formidable weapon in the world. They may have their own doubts as to
the wisdom of such a policy, but they do not frankly say to one another
that the time has come to conform to totally changed conditions. If, and
when, they do, I venture to believe that the battleship will be ranked with
the other bygone things of the spacious past.
The Situation in the Pacific
By Major K. B. Ferguson, R.G.A. (Retd.), Journal of the Royal United
Service Institution, May, 1925.-The problems of the Pacific are the prob-
lems of half the globe. On the circumference of this huge ocean are
China, Japan, Siberia, Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Central
American States with the Panama Canal, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile,
New Zealand, Australia. In addition to these independent states are a
multitude of dependencies, islands, archipelagoes, varying in size and im-
portance from French Indo-China, the Philippine Islands, Borneo, Java, and
Sumatra, to little coral atolls like Pitcairn Island that stands like oases in
a desert of waters. The Pacific Ocean extends from Arctic regions off
Alaska to the Anarctic waters of Ross Sea; and two of the states alone,
China and the United States, include between them one third of the human
race. It is vast in size, and full of fascination. Since it first became known
to Europeans, it has appealed to the imagination of travelers and ad-
venturers; it now appeals also to students of politics, because it is the
scene of international interests that are becoming more momentous every
year.
In a short study today, we can only lay stress upon one or two points
out of scores that offer themselves. I shall first take a glance from the
Japanese point of view. Then I shall turn to the American point of view.
Thirdly, I shall emphasize the importance of China. Finally, I hope to
bring out the lesson which it seems to me all political problems teach us :
the need to consolidate our own Empire, so that in strengthening itself,
it may become a strength and stay to others.
I
Japan has a strong strategical position in the Pacific, and she has
improved the advantage by raising herself to a high pitch of efficiency,
both on land and at sea. But, she has two difficult problems before her ;
one is an outlet for her population, which is growing rapidly; the other is
the problem of external supplies in time of war.
(1) The population of Japan proper is roughly 56,000,000; including
Korea, Formosa, and Saghalien, it is roughly 77,000,000. It increases in
Japan at the rate of about 600,000 a year, and that country is already
closely packed. It is not so dense per square mile as ours in England;
but whereas we have many of the fairest and most fertile portions of the
globe to go to-Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, the Colonies and
Protectorates—the Japanese have at present only Korea, Formosa, and
one half of Saghalien, no one of which offers much scope to an ambitious

and enterprising people. Canada, the United States, Australia, and New
Zealand are closed, or are closing, their doors to the Japanese. They
would find space enough, and to spare, in Manchuria and Siberia; but
Russia is beginning to show signs of returning to the old Muscovite policy
which we associate with the Tsarist régime, and will probably close
Siberia to the Japanese unless they are prepared to fight for it, which is
out of the question.
No man can foresee what way Japan will find out of her difficulty,
and I wish purposely to avoid wasting time in speculation about the
future. We can only note the broad fact that an expanding population
must go somewhere, and the other broad fact that all the obvious outlets
are closed. A rising flood must find an outlet or produce a catastrophe.
We know what happened in our own country. England developed slowly
in the 1500's, 1600's, and 1700's. Then, with the dawn of the Industrial
Age, she went forward rapidly, and during the last half century we have
been living in a whirl of motor cars, wireless, American "pep," democracy,
and emancipated women. So it is with Japan. It has been estimated
that during the 230-odd years that she shut herself off from the world,
roughly from the time of Charles I to the middle of Queen Victoria's
reign, her population only increased by some 26,000,000. During the last
sixty years, on the other hand, the rise of Japan has been meteoric and
bewildering; and if she goes on at the same rate, it is evident that her
surplus population must find some place to go to. So much for her first
problem.
(2) Her second problem concerns her supplies in time of war. Like
Great Britain, she is dependent on external sources; she can never again
be self supporting. A hundred years ago, the Japanese cultivated their
rice fields, and lived on the produce thereof; rice and fish were their
staple food, they were a self-centered and self-supporting community. Then
they suddenly flung their doors open and became a World Power. They
wanted ships and commerce, iron works and coal; that constant flow of
raw material, of exports and imports, that an industrial nation demands.
But Japan has no more acreage now than she had a hundred years ago,
and the Law of Diminishing Returns does not forget to act. So she has
to get raw materials and foodstuffs from abroad, in the same way as we
do ourselves. The government is making strenuous efforts to increase the
productivity of the land, chiefly in the output of rice, so as to make the
country self-supporting again. But the tendencies are against it. The
Japanese, for instance, are eating increasing quantities of meat, and want-
ing an improved standard of living, with more luxury and comfort; and as
this tendency becomes more marked every year, Japan will depend more
and more on foreign trade. Therein lies a danger, which the efforts of the
most peaceful-minded statesman cannot prevent. We shall see commercial
and industrial competition increasing in the Far East, and there is no
reason to doubt that it will lead to armed conflict some day, as it did among
ourselves in Europe a few years ago.
I would like, at this stage, to point to a group of figures which show
the industrial development of Japan within the lifetime of a middle-aged
man of today. In 1868, or fifty-six years ago, at the time of the restoration
to power of the grandfather of the present Mikado, she had no factories
at all in the modern sense. In 1900 she had some 7,000; today she has about
25,000.
The growth of Japanese shipping has kept pace with this rapid industrial
growth. Japan has her trade routes not only across the Pacific, but over
the whole world; and we, who realize that the safety of our empire
depends on our being able to keep our trade routes open, can sympathize
with her, because she is in the same position. If her communications

Professional Notes
with the outer world are cut, she will be in danger of starvation, not
only in the matter of food, but also of raw materials-wool, cotton, iron,
etc. It is not enough for her to have a strong strategical position if she
remains vulnerable on those lines of communication. It is not enough to
know that in her corner of the Pacific, thousands of miles from Europe
and the United States, she cannot be beaten in direct attack. She has to
bear in mind the fact that she could be worn down without being attacked,
if her supplies were cut off.
That is her point of view toward America and Europe. But she also
has to take into account the two remarkable Powers to west and north of
her. She may have nothing to fear from China or Russia at the present
moment, because both are in a chaotic state of government. But if we are
to believe the best authorities on China, that vast country is being
gradually transformed. I do not think that any amount of transformation
will ever make the Chinese an aggressive race, because we have four
thousand ycars of their history to show that it is not in them. They
have from the earliest times been a pastoral and agricultural people, good
traders and workers, good artisans and laborers; never a fighting race
like the Japanese or Prussians. But they may quite conceivably develop
more power to resist aggression on the part of others, and that is enough
to alarm Japan. Roosevelt, in his Autobiography, wrote of "the frightful
calamities that have befallen China because she has had no power of
self defense." Perhaps without ever becoming aggressive she will develop
that power of self defense; and if she does, Japan, like all the rest of us,
will have her work cut out for her.
North of China, again, is the formidable power of Russia-outwardly
changed, as a man's appearance is changed after fearful sickness, but in
essentials the same as ever before. Do you remember the stories we used to
hear about exiles to Siberia in the time of the Tsars? about sinister secret
police of Russia? about the squalor and sufferings of the mujik? about the
fiendish cruelties of Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great? about the
expansion of Russia towards Turkestan and Mongolia, and her ambition
to have outlets on the Black Sea and the Pacific? It is all just the same
now; if they manage to retain power, the present rulers of Russia will
follow on the same line as the old ones; or, if they are driven out by some
new Ivan or Peter, he will go on as before. If we do not realize that,
Japan does. When she looks ahead, she has to take into account the
likelihood, if not the certainty, that some day China, or Russia, or both,
will become a grave menace to her. Now that she has annexed Korea and
so planted her foot on the mainland, she is even more precariously involved
than if she were only an island power. It is as if we came into possession
of Denmark, or of the Cherbourg promontory in the north of France.
Think what a difference it would make to our position in Europe !
I cannot dwell longer on the Japanese point of view, so I merely repeat
the three points on which I have laid stress:
1. The problem of her surplus population.
2. The problem of external supplies.
3. The possible danger from China and Russia as near neighbors.
I now cross over to the other side of the Pacific, and look at the
situation from the American point of view.
II
Our American cousins have their frailties and virtues like everyone
else, but false modesty is not one of them. They do not underrate their
own importance in the world. They are convinced that the U.S.A. is
the greatest of the Great Powers, the hub of the universe, and that they
must be "top dog" in the Pacific. The Japanese have precisely the same

idea about their own country, so the two must necessarily come into
conflict; not armed conflict, perhaps, but economic conflict, and a conflict
of ambitions.
The United States gave hostages to fortune when they stretched across
the Pacific to Hawaii and the Philippines. It is not for a humble student
of world politics to judge whether, on balance, they are a source of
advantage or a weakness to her. One of the greatest of modern Americans,
Theodore Roosevelt, held that the Philippines were indispensable to America
as an advanced base. Other strategists deny this, and go so far as to
say that the Philippines would be a gift to Japan within the first few
weeks of a conflict, because before an American fleet could steam 5,000-
odd miles to defend this base, the Japanese would be in possession of it;
and furthermore, that the American fleet would then be helpless for lack
of coal, and would consequently be at the mercy of the enemy. However
that may be, America has thrown herself right across the Pacific, and in
the Philippines she is the very door of China. We cannot blame the
Japanese if they feel misgivings about this. Mr. Rooosevelt himself told
them that their sphere was in Asia, while the American sphere was on
the continent of America: in other words, that each power could keep on
its own side of the Pacific, and they need never collide. If in spite of that
they see the United States spreading across to the Philippines, with stepping
stones at Hawaii, Midway Island, and Guam, they are quite right to take
necessary precautions.
The attitude which Americans have taken up over the immigration
question has naturally accentuated the rivalry between them and the
Japanese. The Americans of the Pacific States, who are the people who
matter in this case, dislike and look down on the Japanese. They make
no distinction between them and the Chinese, Siamese, or other races of
Eastern Asia, but bracket them all together as "yellow men"; in fact,
many of these people, who for twenty years have been agitating for the
exclusion of the Japanese, and who are at the back of the recent anti-
immigrant troubles, look upon them as simply another form of "nigger."
The intense racial feeling along the Pacific coast is not comprehensible
to us in England for the same reason why we cannot understand the
intense feeling of the French against the Germans. We have never been
in the same peril as France from a stronger neighbor on our frontier,
and we have not enough imagination to put ourselves in her place. In
the same way, England enjoys immunity from racial dangers, and people
who are thus immune cannot imagine how those dangers affect other
people. The objection of the Americans to Japanese is partly racial and
partly economic. It is racial in that they object to the idea of having
Japanese proprietors of American soil, employing American men and
women in a subordinate capacity. It is economic in the sense that the
American artisan or laborer cannot compete with Japanese labor, which
is equally efficient and very much cheaper. So American trade unions are
up in arms. Our own people in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are
not less emphatic than the Americans, and do not differentiate much
between Japanese and other yellow or brown races.
The Americans are quite within their rights in objecting to a Japanese
invasion. Mr. Roosevelt put the case fairly and squarely, as usual, when
he said: “The Japanese themselves would not tolerate the intrusion into
their country of a mass of Americans who would displace Japanese in the
business of the land. I think they are entirely right in this position. I
would be the first to admit that Japan has the absolute right to declare
on what terms foreigners shall be admitted to work in her country, or to
own land in her country, or to become citizens in her country. America
has and must insist upon the same right. The people of California were

right in insisting that the Japanese should not come thither in mass, that
there should be no influx of laborers, of agricultural workers, or small
tradesmen-in short, no mass settlement or immigration."
The Japanese complaint is that the recent American legislation is uncalled
for. They maintain that the so-called “Gentlemen's Agreement" of 1908,
under which Japan herself, out of deference to America, restricted the
flow of Japanese immigrants into the U.S.A., was working well and doing
all that was necessary and that the new legislation discriminates between
immigrants from Japan, who are shut out, and those from France, Italy,
and other European countries, who are still allowed to come in. In other
words, they complain that the issue is now purely racial, and insulting to
them.
It is naturally an intolerable position for them. They resent being
classed with Chinese and other Asiatic races, because they consider that the
events of the last thirty years have given them a superior status. They
also resent the suggestion of inferiority to white races which is implied in
their exclusion from white men's countries, because they consider, quite
rightly, that those events have put them on a footing of equality with the
white races. They defeated the Russians twenty years ago, and sat in
judgment on the Germans and Austrians after the Great War. They were
among the Big Five at Versailles; and, after having accepted their aid in
1914, we can scarcely turn around now and deny them equal rights with
ourselves.
How far Japan will be able to redress this inequality and assert
a right to enter other people's countries,-this remains to be seen. It is
a problem of the Pacific which we or our descendants will some day come
up against in an acute form. For the present America has made up her
mind, and is not going to draw back. She is evidently determined to make
the Pacific seaboard safe for her own democracy. She sets us a good
example in this respect.
Will Japan fight America ? The question is constantly raised, but
is one of those speculative problems with which I have no time to deal here.
It seems to me that Japan is in more danger from China or Russia than
from the U.S.A., or ourselves on the other side of the great Ocean.
Whether in a passive or an active rôle, she is more closely committed in
northeastern Asia than anywhere else, and is more likely to come into
conflict with her rivals there. Now that she is being shut out from the
North American continent and from Australasia, she has has an additional
reason to look westward for means of expansion. Secondly, the annexa-
tion of Korea has made her a continental power. Thirdly, Russia contains
aggressive elements which may at any time renew the menace to Japan in
the Far East. For more than one reason, therefore, Japan has to watch
her neighbors to west and northwest of her carefully.
III
I have sketched briefly the points of view of Japan and the United
States. Behind these two protagonists is the vast form of China.
China is the pivot round which all Pacific problems revolve. In size
she is one of the greatest powers on that ocean; in population she is by
far the greatest. You will find that every one of the western powers, in
its outlook upon the Pacific, keeps one eye all the time on China. We
have all tried, with vary success, to grab portions of her territory. We
have tried to dominate her trade, and obtain the first place in her huge
markets. We have heard allusions to the "yellow peril," "slumbering
millions" and "awakening giants.” But what is not always realized fully
is the latent strength of the Chinese. Most of us look upon them as an
inferior race, only semi-civilized and very backward. Backward they cer-

tainly are, if we take them collectively. The peasants and laborers in
remote parts of the country live in a state of ignorance, squalor, and misery,
though I doubt if it is worse than in Russia and other parts of Europe.
On the other hand, the better class of Chinese are an exceedingly fine race.
To look upon them as inferior to ourselves, or less civilized, would show
ignorance on our own part. They have traditions that go back not only
beyond our Norman and Anglo-Saxon periods, but far beyond the early
ages of Greek and Roman civilization. They are people of great natural
ability, supreme in every branch of commerce. And in addition to their
natural ability, they have a courtesy of manner that makes them pleasant to
deal with, either in business or in social intercourse.
They are extraordinary people; and it strikes me more forcibly the
longer I think about it, that China is not conquerable. You cannot
conquer such an immense mass of people, and their civilization is so
strongly rooted that you cannot even shake it seriously. At present,
however, this vast and clumsy organization has no head, no organization,
no fixed purpose, no means of carryng out a purpose. Yet it is very
much alive, and its potential strength is beyond the reach of our imagina-
tion. To talk of Japan conquering it, or annexing it, or even guiding it, is
unthinkable to me, because China is greater than Japan in every way but
one: namely, that she hates and despises fighting and every form of
strenuous competition. That seems to me to be the only respect in which
she is not the equal or superior of any other people, white, brown, or
yellow.
I shall not attempt to give an outline of Chinese political history
during the last few months. Chinese civil warfare has a style of its own,
not like anything else with which we are familiar. And even if I could
explain the ups and downs of Chang Tso Lin, Wu Pei Fu, Feng Yu Hsiang,
Tuan Chi Jui, and other Celestial leaders, it would serve no useful purpose,
because the relation of these men to the inner life of China is the relation
of foam on the crest of a wave to the deep waters that lie beneath. I
would, however, emphasize the fact that China is changing, slowly,
perhaps, but surely, under the influence of western civilization. Nothing
will make the Chinese become European. They have too much indi-
viduality; and a civilization that has endured for 4,000, 5,000, or 6,000 years
is not going to alter fundamentally in the course of a man's lifetime. But
they will alter externally, even as we have altered in the last fifty years,
though we are still the same people of Shakespeare and Nelson. Scientific
knowledge, hygiene, and mechanical invention will filter through these
myriads of people, and make a vast difference in them. Observers on the
spot tell us there has already been an extraordinary change in the last few
years. You have no doubt heard about the Young China Movement,
which is largely directed by young students and people of radical, not to
say revolutionary, tendencies. Like youthful enthusiasts all the world
over, these young Chinese want to reform everything, and obtain the
millennium by return post. Their zeal often outruns their judgment and
their powers; but they are a great force, and their influence upon the future
of their country is likely to be momentous.
What China needs today is a strong government to keep order and
assist in her development. At present the weakness of the central
government is a hindrance to herself, and is a source of anxiety and danger
to everyone else. The lives and property of our fellow-countrymen can
never be thoroughly safe with an unstable government that cannot put
a stop to bandit outrages and the vagaries of military chieftains. On the
other hand, a well-ordered and prosperous China will tend toward
stability. It is not in the Chinese to be an aggressive nation, and the idea
of swarms of them rushing forth to invade the American Continent,

Australia, and New Zealand is fanciful. They will be more likely to assert
their right to regulate their trade with us, and to shut out foreigners when
they feel inclined. That may become inconvenient for us from the
commercial point of view, but we cannot deny them that elementary right
if we go on calling them a sovereign power. Such an eventuality is,
however, not likely to happen in our time.
Before passing on to the concluding portion of my lecture-the
consideration of our own position in the Pacific-let me sum up a few
impressions. The general impression we get from our subject is that
forces are rising up in the Pacific which may some day get out of control.
(1) One is the expansion of Japan, whose population is increasing rapidly,
but is refused admission into other countries where it might find an outlet.
(2) A second force is rising up in China. Her population question is also
likely to become acute, especially if she adopts western methods of
hygiene, and avoids the frightful wastage which has hitherto been due to
disease and pestilence. (3) A third is the expansion of the United States,
which are still as it were a young giant, growing rapidly. (4) On the
north-west corner of the Pacific is a fourth-Russia, a huge power, of
which no wise man would attempt to predict the future five years ahead.
(5) In the northeast and the southwest of the great ocean you find our
own empire, represtented by Canada, New Zealand, Australia, various
dependencies, and two links in the chain which binds London to the Far
East, Singapore and Hong Kong. Here are five forces that are growing up
in the Pacific; and we have made no mention of the interests of France in
Cochin China, or of the South American States.
Another impression we get from this study is that the broad line of
cleavage in the Pacific is racial, and not national. Japan belongs to Asia;
the inhabitants of America belong to Europe. If Japan were to fight
Canada or Australia for the right of immigration, the U.S.A. would join in
with our Dominions, and vice versa. The same idea is at the back of the
Japanese mind when they think of an Asiatic Monroe Doctrine-Asia for
the Asiatics. It is a perfectly just idea. Japan ought to support China
in her claim to independence, and if she were large-minded enough to do
so, they would be a formidable combination. But at present it seems un-
likely, because there is hatred between the two. Like other nations, Japan,
instead of helping China, has aimed at suppressing her, and squeezing
everything out of her that could be squeezed. The Chinese have been
alive to this, and will try some day to get their own back from the
Japanese. Yet this does not alter the fact that Japan really belongs to
Asia, and must find her ultimate development along Asiatic, and not
European, line.

Meanwhile, how do we stand ourselves in the Pacific? The British
Empire is potentially the greatest power in the world at present, and she
has interests in the Pacific second to no other. Three of the Dominions
are there; two of the foremost trading centers in the world, Hong Kong
and Singapore; and groups of dependencies like Fiji, British North Borneo,
New Guinea, and the Mandatory Islands south of the Equator. We are
thus involved on the western seaboard, on the eastern, and on the southern.
Only to the northwest, where Japan, China, and Russia stand facing one
another, is there no portion of the British Empire.
Our position in the southwestern Pacific has received much attention
of late in connection with the question of Singapore. I try to look at that
question not from the point of view of a soldier, who may be expected to
show professional bias, but from that of a plain citizen, who only has an
ordinary measure of common sense to go by. Looking at it in that way,

I notice that a continuous chain of bases and coaling stations runs from
the United Kingdom through Gibralter, Malta, the Suez Canal, and Aden,
or alternately through Sierra Leone, Cape Town, and Mauritius, to
Ceylon and Singapore, and from there to Hong Kong in one direction,
Australia and New Zealand in the other. If we are prepared to adopt
the policy of Denmark, and leave ouselves entirely unprotected, well and
good. But if we are going to make any preparations at all in case trouble
should arise, it appears to me to follow that Singapore should be strongly
fortified, so that our chain cannot be broken there. The more I study
other nations, the less I like those things with the new-fangled name of
"moral gestures.” A moral gesture is the last thing to earn the respect
of a Japanese, or a Chinese Tuchum, or a high-minded American, or a
patriotic Frenchman; they will like us better if we say to them fairly and
squarely: "We propose to fortify Singapore because it is a vital point on
our line of communications between London and our people in the Pacific.
It is obviously no menace to you Japanese and Americans because it is too
far from either of you, and is outside the zone that we agreed upon at the
Washington Conference, within which no new fortifications were to be
constructed. Our ships in Far Eastern waters need a base where they
can be secure and can carry out necessary repairs. Singapore is better
than Hong Kong for another reason: That it gives us more security against
aircraft; and the volume of trade that passes through the Malacca Straits
is so vast that we must have the means of protecting it adequately."
I can understand, without necessarily accepting it, the argument
that advocates Sydney Harbor in preference to Singapore. I can also
understand, without necessarily accepting it, the argument of those
critics who contend that a fortified base at Singapore is a waste of money
in these days of submarines and aircraft. But I cannot work up any
sympathy with "moral gestures," and am out of touch with people who
appear afraid of what Japan or America may say about Singapore. The
Prime Minister said recently in fine words: “Our duty is to lead the
world, and not to follow anybody." If we apply that test to Singapore,
we shall do what our responsibility imposes upon us, and not wait for the
approval of the powers. The best men in every country know quite well
what our motives are, and those are the only men who really matter.
It is instructive to contrast the positions of Canada and the Australasian
Dominions in the Pacific. Canada is the go-between between the United
States and ourselves. She has so much in common with the United States
that she will frequently appreciate their point of view when it is obscure
to us; at the same time she has a national consciousness strong enough
to remind the United States that they are only one half of the North
American Continent. We cannot be too often reminded of the standing
wonder of that undefended frontier of 3,000 miles between Canada and
the United States. I know nothing like it in Europe,
Australia and New Zealand, not being in contact with another Power,
have a difficult character from that of Canada. In spite of their distance
from us, away at the Antipodes, they are in closer sympathy with the
Mother Country, and in their relation to the problem of the Pacific they
look solely to themselves and the Home country, having no powerful
neighbor to think about. The Singapore question, which is vital to
Australia and New Zealand, does not affect Canada in the same way.
Australia and New Zealand depend more on us than Canada does; and if
all three feel anxiety about competition from Asiatics, Australia, and New
Zealand look to us for protection, whereas Canada derives a great deal of
security from the fact that any menace to her is a menace also to the
United States, which they will help her to repel. For that reason Singa-

pore is of vital consequence to the Australasian Dominions; it is the first
link in the chain that binds them to London.
I would not feel justified in attempting to discuss the situation in the
Pacific from the point of view of naval stragety. I am to some extent
afraid of the frown of authority, but still more afraid of the ridicule of
critics who know more about naval strategy than I do. I notice that each
of the three strongest powers in the Pacific says one of the others is doing
something she should not do under the Washington Agreement; some-
times it relates to gun elevation, sometimes to naval maneuvers, or to
fortresses, or vessels other than capital ships. It is too much to expect
anyone to trust anyone else in those distant waters. Japan learnt a
bitter lesson in 1895, when Russia, Germany, and France squeezed her
out of the Liao Tung Peninsula on an unctuous pretext, only for Russia
to step into her place three years later and seize the very territory she
had said it would be wrong for Japan to occupy. The dubious action of
Japan in presenting her Twenty-one Demands to China in 1915 may have
been the natural outcome of the treachery she had experienced twenty
years later. The British Empire will remain predominant in the Pacific,
as it ought to be, if it is entirely open handed in its dealings with friends
and rivals alike.
This study of the problems of the Pacific has led me to two conclusions,
among others :
(1) That many of the dealings of the western powers with China
cannot be defended on any principle except that Might is Right. Might
need not necessarily mean any form of oppression or cruelty. It can go
with courtesy, chivalry, mercy, justice, and kindliness. It can be used to
make men happier, healthier, and in every way better. But from the
time when Europeans first appeared in the Pacific until today, the Chinese
and Japanese have never wanted them; and if we have any right to be
there, it is might only that gives us that right. It would be foolish to
suggest that we should evacuate China merely because China does not
want us, but perhaps some day China will put her house in order, and be
in a position to compel us to treat her in the same way that we treat Japan,
France, or any other power with which we have dealings.
(2) My second conclusion arises out of that possibility: it is, that the
line upon which we of the British Empire should go in the future should be
not only to allow China, but even to assist her, to develop her power. We
must never admit the idea Japan expressed in 1914 when she said she
could not tolerate the awakening of some 400 million Chinese which would
follow if China went into the war on the side of the Allies. A man who
begins by being afraid of his rival is already half beaten. The British
Empire has no occasion to be afraid of any other power, least of all of
China, because as I have pointed out more than once, the Chinese have
never, since the dawn of their history, been an aggressive race. To those
who are still afraid of a "yellow peril," I would commend the reading of
a small book called “The Awakening of Japan," by Okakura Kakuzo,
published in 1905. He says there:
"Not once during the whole of their history do we find the native dynasties
of China and India coming into collision with one another. The only oc-
casion on which China ever menaced Japan was in the 12th century, when
her own Mongol conquerors tried to impose their authority upon us." (203).
Recent events in China may give the impression that a military spirit
is becoming prevalent there, and that the present system of Tuchuns, all
at loggerheads with one another, reducing the government of the country
to a state of chaos, may be followed some day by the rise of a super-
Tuchun, another Yuan Shi Kai, who would first consolidate his own power,

and then direct it against us Europeans. It is conceivable if we imagine
such a man merely asserting the sovereignty, independence, territorial and
administrative integrity of China. It is not conceivable if we imagine
any active designs against us; any threat to our Dominions and Possessions
in the Pacific. It is conceivable that the young people of to-day may live
to see China an independent State in the same sense that Japan is, having
done away with extra-territoriality, and compelled us to deal with her as
an equal, not an inferior Power. But from that to becoming an active
menace to other nations is a far cry. It is not necessary for us to trouble
ourselves about the possibility for the present.
I can, however, see no limits to the expansion of the Chinese if, after
assimilating our knowledge of science and hygiene, they increase and
multiply even more rapidly than at present. It is appalling to think that
if they multiply even at the same rate as we do—and our rate of increase
is not very rapid-they must have added 60,000,000 to their popualtion
since I was in China as a subaltern! 60,000,000! and the whole population
of the United Kingdom is only about 43,000,000! A force like this is,
as I said before, something elemental which it passes the wit of man to
cope with. Nature alone can cope with it. She has hitherto kept down
that immense population by various means-partly by an extra strenuous
application of the law of survival of the fittest, in various forms of
plague, pestilence, and famine; partly by visitations like the Taiping Re-
bellion, which is said to have cost 15,000,000 lives; partly by physical
agencies like the Yangtze shifting it course from one bed to another and
drowning people like swarms of insects. In what way she will deal with the
problems of a new China which has adopted Western scientific methods
and engineering we cannot attempt to foretell.
In the present consideration of every problem that arises, we have
one question to ask ourselves: What is the best line to take for the welfare
of the Empire?-remembering always that it is our duty to lead the
world, and not to follow anybody. If there were any way of obtaining the
opinion of the Chinese and Japanese as a whole, it would be seen that we
stand higher in their regard than any other Power. I am inclined to agree
with the author of that excellent new work-Western Civilization and
the Far East, Lieutenant Commander Stephen King Hall, R.N.—that the
reason for this is that in our dealings with them we have never made
professions of idealism, which they do not understand, but have gone on
straightforward business lines, which they can grasp. We have, too, the
initial advantage of standing high in the regard of all Asiatic races. They
naturally do not like us, partly because they do not go in for altruism
and universal love, but still more because it would be too much to expect
anyone to like strangers who come in at the gate unbidden and refuse to
go away again. Without liking us, however, they respect us, and if we
remain the strong and straightforward people we have been, they will
continue to respect us.
If we keep before us the idea of a strong and united empire, we
shall avoid mistakes that others have made. I have already alluded to a
Japanese idea on the outbreak of the Great War, that if China were allowed
to come in on the side of the Allies, it would lead to an awakening of her
400 million people, and would be a menace to Japan. That is an unworthy
notion. Japan can never lead the Asiatic races, as she aspires to do, if
she is afraid of them and keeps them in bondage, and they will not
be worth leading. The Japanese make a mistake in supressing, or trying
to suppress, the Chinese. If they had been more large-minded, they could
by this time have bound the Chinese to them by bonds of gratitude, and
made themselves all-powerful in the Western Pacific.

Professional Notes
If we keep to our Imperial ideals, we shall also avoid the mistake
certain Americans are making in exasperating the Japanese by their im-
migration laws. I have never seen any reason given for supposing that
the “Gentlemen's Agreement" of 1908, by which Japan herself undertook
to restrict her immigration into the United States, was not sufficient. So
far as an outsider can see, it would appear that extremist opinion has
prevailed over more moderate counsels, and that something has been done
that was uncalled for. The Japanese will not forget it; no self-respecting
nation would. I am afraid there has been a lack of generosity on the side
of the Americans of late, and I devoutly hope my own countrymen will
take note of it, and banish every thought of jealousy and fear from their
minds.
It appears to me to be inevitable that a conflict should occur some day
in the Pacific, hut it may not take the obvious form of a fight between two
nations like Japan and the United States. The leaders of Japan are too
shrewd to take on such a colossal fight with their present resources, and
the United States are not likely to initiate such a war. It is more likely
to be a struggle between East and West; between two civilizations, Oriental
and Occidental; between their idea of Contentment and our idea of Progress.
A struggle of that kind is not to be settled by war. We have the example
of the last war to prove that: It has settled nothing. The conflict between
France and Germany is as bitter as ever; so is the so-called conflict between
Capital and Labor; while a new form of plague has arisen, Bolshevism,
the final effect of which no man can foretell.
When this huge conflict in the Pacific does come, it will take a course
as unexpected as that of the Great War, and produce still more frightful
results. But we cannot prevent it by saying "Oh! how dreadful.” We
shall do better to admit that it will come, and shape our policy accordingly.
In my humble opinion, the best preparation we can make is, by every
word, thought, and act, to help to consolidate the British Empire; above
all, to have things in good order here, in the United Kingdom, because
the empire will always depend on the Mother Country, and our destinies
in the Pacific will be unrolled here, in London. This in our interests,
but also in the interests of others. The development of China; the
future progress of Japan, the revival of Russia in the Far East; the
racial and economic problems of the United States on their Pacific sea-
board; the security of Australia and New Zealand-all these will be
affected, for better or for worse, by the condition of the British Empire
as a whole. The destinies of the Pacific, which are the destinies of half
the globe, depend more than we realize on this little island of ours, whose
sons
"are neither children nor gods, but men in a world of men.”

NOTES ON INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
FROM 7 JUNE TO 7 JULY
PREPARED BY
PROFESSOR ALIAN WESTCOTT, U. S. Naval ACADEMY
EUROPEAN SECURITY NEGOTIATIONS
FRENCH NOTE TO GERMANY.—The course of negotiations between Great
Britain, France, and Germany for a mutual security agreement, affecting
especially the Rhine frontier, was made clear on June 18 by full publication
ini m vermany Tomar mutual security a teement, ater
of the German proposal for a Rhine compact made last February, the
British and French correspondence preliminary to a reply, and finally
the French note to Germany delivered on June 16 with the full approval
of the British Foreign Office.
In brief the British attitude, as indicated in the correspondence, was
that Great Britain in the interests of European peace was willing to give
up her policy of isolation, and pledge herself to the use of force in
guarantee of the Rhine frontier. But while Great Britain looked with
favor upon the establishment of arbitration treaties between France and
Germany or with other European powers she was not prepared to guarantee
them by force. In other words, Great Britain would guarantee only the
Rhine frontier.
The French reply to Germany on June 16 was cautious but generally
conciliatory and favorable. It accepted the idea of a compact guaranteeing
the Rhine boundary, and also an agreement to arbitrate all issues between
France and Germany, subject, however, to certain conditions. These in-
cluded: (1) Germany's entrance into the League of Nations; (2) Ger-
many's full acceptance of all the provisions of the Versailles Treaty, and
also her acceptance of other treaties resulting from the war; (3) inclusion
of Belgium; (4) negotiation of arbitration treaties between Germany and
her other neighbors. The note in conclusion stated that France would be
glad to see the United States associated "in this work of general peace and
security.”
FRENCH PRESS FAVORABLE (From New York Times of June 20).–Paris,
June 19.-The French press almost unanimously agrees the compact offered
to Germany in response to the Reich's proposals of February 9 is as complete
a guarantee of European peace as could possibly be realized under present
conditions. Obviously the weak point from the French view is the refusal
of England to bind herself to intervention on the east front as she does
on the Rhine front, but even this difficulty is believed to be solved in Great

[Aug.
Britain's agreement to fulfill all obligations that may be imposed upon her
by membership in the League of Nations should the League establish a
case of aggression against the territories of France's allies in Eastern
Europe.
In fact, for the French the most important document published in con-
nection with the note itself is that concerning the liberty of France to
occupy the Rhine zone in event of an act of aggression by Germany against
any of her eastern allies. It is generally conceded the note itself is not
any too clear on the subject. Foreign Minister Briand, in order not to
offend German pride, evidently had to glide over this aspect of the situation
gently and diplomatically, but the French insist the stipulation is unquestion-
ably there by reason of Austen Chamberlain's letter of June 9, in which the
British Premier agrees the Rhine compact must in no way prevent France
"from exercising any action conforming with the guarantees which she shall
have been accorded under arbitration treaties between Germany and her
neighbors."
One viewpoint which deviates from the general tone of optimism in the
French press is that of Pertinax in the Echo de Paris, who declares the
success of the Briand-Chamberlain compact is theoretical rather than real.
“The pact is essentially bilateral, as noted in the speech of Mr. Chamber-
lain on March 24 and the recent speech of Mr. Baldwin," he says. “Between
France and Germany the pact establishes British arbitration. If we ever
want to cross the Rhine, this arbitration, determined by British interests and
conceptions at the moment, will become for us a powerful obstacle."
In the main, however, the French press agrees the compact will con-
stitute full protection of French interests if Germany becomes a member
of the League of Nations and thereby binds herself to decisions of the
League. The compact conforming sufficiently to German proposals of
February 9, the French do not see how Germany can avoid acceptance.
In this discussion of the security compact considerable regret is being
expressed that it must go into effect without the adherence of the United
States. General Taufleib, examining this aspect of the situation in the
Information, lays stress on the advantages to the United States from
participation should trouble arise in the Far East.
"Ever since participation of the United States in regulating the problem
of reparations through application of the Dawes plan," says General
Tauflieb, "the United States, in fact, has adopted a course of action which
logically should result in adhesion to a pact guaranteeing the security of
the principal European nations. Would not such an accord help to solve
the question of disarmament which our American friends hold so much to
heart? In attaching its signature to a pact of this kind the American
Government would give it force and authority such as would make the
pact an irresistible instrument of peace. I know the reluctance of our
American friends to become involved in new European quarrels. But let
them turn their eyes to the clouds menacing from the direction of the Pacific
and Asia. Are not events developing between Moscow and Peking which
are likely to change the scene of international preoccupations? The struggle
of tomorrow in all likelihood will find Asiatic peoples encouraged by Com-
munist propaganda and supported by Japan on one side and the United
States on the other, assisted by European powers in an effort to defend
the present social state. In this struggle the United States will feel the
necessity of having behind it the support of Europe, united, strong and
fully prepared to concentrate itself to its cause."
BRITISH Press COMMENT (From Living Age of June 13).-The Outlook
(London) is not hopeful that France and Great Britain will be able to agree
upon a security pact under any circumstances, and whatever hope it

cherished in this direction has been dashed by the uncompromising attitude
manifested by the Little Entente at the Bucharest Conference last month.
Britain will never consent to go to war to maintain the present frontiers in
Eastern Europe, while France can hardly permit a change in these frontiers.
France, then, must choose between the sea power of Britain and the
land power of Central Europe, and is, of course, free to avail herself of
that arm which she thinks will benefit her most. No British statesman and
no British journalist would presume to guide her choice. But one word of
caution may be uttered. Before 1914 she combined an entente with Britain
with an alliance with Russia. That combination cannot be repeated because
there is no German fleet a-building nowadays. She can have her pact in the
West or her pact in the East; but not both.
Sisley Huddleston says in the New Statesman that France cannot sur-
render her present system of alliances for any kind of general pact without
discussion, and then only subject to the following conditions:
(1) The unconditional entry of Germany into the League of Nations
before the pact comes into force. Those who derive amusement from the
inconsistencies of diplomacy will appreciate the irony which is to be found
in France's insistence on Germany's admission into the League from which
she was anxious not long ago to exclude her former enemy.
(2) The strict observance of all the Articles of the Versailles Treaty,
particularly in respect of Germany's disarmament and the demilitarization
of Rhineland.
(3 The consolidation of the territorial status quo for the German
frontiers in the East as in the West.
(4) The inclusion of England as a party to such a pact, with all that
such inclusion implies in the shape of direct action against the one country
which France fears may denounce any of its clauses.
The Little Entente is alarmed not only by Germany's reservations in
her proposal for a security pact, which imply an eventual readjustment of
her eastern frontiers at the expense particularly of Poland, but also by the
rumor that she may use this reservation to trade upon in securing a union
with Austria. It is the latter possibility that has alarmed Czecho-Slovakia,
which is not directly threatened by Germany's other frontier claims. As a
correspondent in the Nation and the Athenaum says:
Such a union would be the first and least contestable change which
Germany could claim on her eastern frontier, for it is indeed hard to see
by what principle of nationality, self-determination, or international comity
German-Austria is refused the right to decide her own fate by a free
plebiscite, and, if she desires, to put an end to the miserable, unnatural
existence she has been forced to lead for these last six and a half years.
This, however, the Czechs are determined to prevent. “The deadly blows
to us," said Dr. Benes once, "have always come from the South; but
Vienna can never deliver them unless she has the strength of Germany
behind her.”
Allies TO EVACUATE RUHR (From New York Times of June 24).--
Paris, June 23.-The Council of Ministers today approved the plans of
Premier Painlevé and Foreign Minister Briand for fulfillment of the promise
given in London by Premier Herriot to evacuate the Ruhr region a year
after the Dawes plan became effective-August 15.
The retirement of the troops, according to the Cabinet's plans, will begin
at an early date, however, and it is expected that the anniversary of the
Dawes plan will see the departure of the last French and Belgian detach-
ments.
. This is another indication of the new order of things in France and
shows the firm intention of the French Government to place the fullest

reliance on the Dawes plan for reparations and on the League of Nations.
It is also assumed that France is confident an agreement with Germany for
the protection of the Rhine front will be effected and that the four or five
conversations in Paris and Berlin between the governments and ambassadors
of the two countries which have taken place since Tuesday of last week
when the French reply to the German offer of a compact delivered to Berlin
are considered as indications that Germany is fairly satisfied with the terms
the French offered.
DEBT NEGOTIATIONS
GREAT BRITAIN Asks SETTLEMENT.—It was announced on July 1 that
the British Government had sent a memorandum to France and all other
nations in debt to Great Britain suggesting that a date be set for opening
negotiations for settlement. The note, while couched in friendly terms,
laid down the principle that Great Britain's debts were entitled to the same
treatment accorded those of other powers.
ITALY AND UNITED STATES OPEN PARLEY.—During the last week in July
preliminary conferences were held in Washington between Treasury
officials and the Italian Ambassador over a settlement of the Italian debt
to the United States. This amounts to about $2,138,500,000, of which about
$500,000,000 represents accrued interest. Ambassador di Martino was ac-
companied by Mario Alberti, of the Credito-Italiano, as financial representa-
tive of the Italian Government. Further negotiations were postponed until
August, during which interval Mr. Alberti went to Italy to collect needed
data.
ARMS TRAFFIC AGREEMENT.-After forty-one days in session the Arms
Traffic Conference ended on June 17. The convention adopted was reported
to be entirely satisfactory to the American delegation. It was signed by
nineteen of the forty-four nations taking part, and becomes valid for each
nation upon formal ratification. On the last day protocols were added out-
lawing the use of poison gas and bacteria in warfare.
The anti-gas protocol closely adheres to the Washington five-power con-
vention. It declares that as the use in war of asphyxiating gas has been
justly condemned by the civilized world, the signatories to the protocol
agree to prohibit its employment or the use of bacteria in warfare.
The arms traffic convention purposes permitting international knowledge
of all movements of arms and war materials from one country to another
by a system of licenses and certificates and a requirement for publicity of
transfers of such arms and materials. Elaborate classifications of various
forms of arms and munitions are made. In some cases licenses or certificates
are required for exports and in other cases publicity of the exports must be
made.
FRANCE
THE WAR IN MOROCCO.—During June the military situation in Morocco
developed few changes. The Riffian offensives, although they inflicted
slight material losses, seriously injured French prestige in Morocco and
spread disaffection among the tribes under French authority. On the other
hand, the defensive policy employed by the French gave no promise of an

early end of hostilities, while the adoption of aggressive measures was made
difficult not only by complications with Spain but by the firm opposition of
the Socialist party in France. Premier Painlevé visited Fez and the
Moroccan front in the middle of June.
Conferences at Madrid between French and Spanish commissioners to
agree upon a joint policy in Morocco continued through June and promised
to extend through July. Agreement was reached upon a plan for a co-
operative blockade of the Mediterranean coast of Morocco by French and
Spanish warships to prevent smuggling of munitions to the warring tribes-
men. Although kept informed daily regarding the negotiations, and es-
pecially concerned in any agreement affecting Tangier, Great Britain did
110t take active part in the Madrid Conferences.
According to Spanish reports, the peace terms demanded by Abd-el-Krim,
leader of the Riff tribesmen, included cession of the whole Wergha valley
and recognition of the complete independence of the "Riff Free State."
CAILLAUX FINANCE MEASURES.—On June 26 Finance Minister Caillaux
introduced in the French Chamber his measures designed to relieve the
difficulties of the French Treasury and make a beginning of the con-
solidation of the floating debt. His proposals included a temporary limited
increase in circulation of 6,000,000,000 francs to meet immediate calls on
the Treasury, and a new issue of bonds at an interest lower than that on
old bonds, but with the inducement that the bonds will be paid at the gold
rate.
UNITED STATES AND LATIN AMERICA
WARNING TO MEXICO.-After conferences with James R. Sheffield.
American Ambassador to Mexico, Secretary of State Kellogg on June 12
made a public statement in which he announced that relations with Mexico
were not entirely satisfactory, that the United States Government expected
Mexico to restore properties illegally taken and to indemnify American
citizens, and that the Calles Government could have the support of the
United States only so long as it protected American lives and rights and
fulfilled its international obligations.
President Calles gave to the press a reply on June 14 declaring that
Mexico was duly carrying out her international obligations, and resenting
what he referred to as the "threat to the sovereignty of Mexico" in Mr.
Kellogg's statement. It was announced on June 24 that Ambassador
Sheffield would return to Mexico with a note specifying the complaints
of the United States over the treatment of American nationals.
NEAR EAST
REVOLUTION IN GREECE.—-On June 25, by a coup d'état without bloodshed,
General Pangalos, head of the Greek army, overthrew the Michalakopoulos
Cabinet and took over the government. Admiral Konduriotis remained
president, and General Pangalos became head of the new ministry. General
Pangalos is an ambitious soldier and strong nationalist.

CHINA
Anti-FOREIGN DISTURBANCES.—Anti-foreign feeling in China came to a
head at Shanghai during the first week in June as a result of a strike in a
Japanese cotton mill, which quickly spread to other factories, and was
encouraged by students and radical political agitators. A general strike
was proclaimed. The movement spread to other cities and threatened to
develop into a nation-wide uprising against foreigners. On June 16 W. W.
Mackenzie, a British engineer, was shot and killed near Shanghai, and on
the following day a British motorcycle policeman of the foreign concession
was mobbed and seriously injured.
At Canton the situation was complicated by warfare between two factions
of the former followers of Sun Yat Sen, the conservative group, the
Yunnanese, being finally driven out of the city by the radical faction. On
June 23 it was reported that British and French machine guns had been
used against Chinese demonstrators who threatened the foreign concession,
and on the following day a French merchant was killed and several
foreigners injured.
Both the French and the British Governments lodged protests against
the killing of their citizens, and strong notes were presented to the Chinese
Government by the diplomatic corps at Peking.
On July 1, when the situation in China had apparently become quieter,
it was announced at Washington that the American State Department was
considering with other powers the advisability of holding in the near future
an international conference on Chinese problems, to consider especially the
surrender of extra-territorial privileges and to permit China to raise the
customs rates on foreign goods. According to the terms of the Nine Power
Treaty negotiated in Washington in 1921, a customs conference to permit
increased duties must be held in China within three months after all nations
had ratified the treaty.
RATIFICATION OF CHINESE TREATIES.—On July 1 Foreign Minister Briand
before a committee of the French Chamber strongly urged immediate
ratification by France of the pending treaties relating to China. Up to
this time France was the only nation that had withheld ratification, with
the motive, apparently, of forcing the Chinese Government to full payment
in gold francs of the French share of the Boxer indemnity. According
to press reports, however, this indebtedness had been settled by an arrange-
ment between the French and Chinese Governments by which China agreed
to a loan-equivalent to a subsidy on account of the low interest-to the
bankrupt French Banque Industrielle de Chine. Complete ratification of the
Chinese treaties would be followed by a customs conference pledged to
grant China an increase of the Chinese tariff rates from 772 per cent to 122
per cent, thus providing the Chinese Government with essential revenues.

BOOK REVIEW
THE TESTING OF HIGH SPEED INTERNAL COM-
BUSTION ENGINES. By Arthur W. Judge. D. Van
Nostrand Company, New York. $7.50 net.
The use of the internal combustion engine today is so universal, and it
has become so intimately associated with our daily lives that most of us
accept its development as a matter of course.
The high standard of efficiency and reliability of the modern internal
combustion engine is in a large measure due to the time and labor spent
in research and test work in the laboratory and on the apparatus of which
the internal combustion engine is the prime mover.
Much time and labor can be saved, and the value of tests and researches
increased if one can use in part the experience of previous investigators.
The author of this volume, due to his vast and varied experience, is
eminently fitted to guide and advise investigators in this kind of work.
The book is intended primarily for internal combustion engineers, manu-
facturers, motor engineers, test and laboratory assistants, students and
others who have to deal with engine tests. Much of the subject matter is of
a fairly elementary nature. For the advanced worker and research en-
gineer a general survey of the subject is given, copiously supplemented with
footnote references to original papers and results, and also with a bibli-
ography.
There are twelve chapters, a bibliography and four appendices as follows:
Chapter I, General Principles ; Chapter II, Test Procedure; Chapter III,
Fuel Tests and Exhaust Gas Analysis ; Chapter IV, Measurement of Air
Supply; Chapter V, Water Supply and Heat Measurements; Chapter VI,
Measurement of Brake Horse Power; Chapter VII, Pressure Measure-
ments; Chapter VIII, Indicator Diagrams: Chapter IX, Temperature
Measurements ; Chapter X, Automobile Testing; Chapter XI, Aircraft
Tests; Chapter XII, The Analysis of High Frequency Movements;
Appendix I, Formulae Used in Test Calculations; Appendix II, S. A. E.
Testing Forms; Appendix III, Air Ministry Schedule of Standard Type
and Production Tests for Aircraft Engines; Appendix IV, The Calculation
of the Quantity of Air which Passes through a Throttle Plate.
The various subjects are well presented in a book of 384 pages, pro-
fusely illustrated with excellent cuts and diagrams.

SECRETARY'S NOTES
The Institute desires articles of interest to all branches
Articles of the service, including the reserve force. Non-
members as well as members may submit articles, and
authors receive due compensation for articles published. Com-
pact, well digested articles are more likely to be accepted for
early publication. In accepting articles for publication, the In-
stitute reserves the right to have such articles revised or rearranged,
where necessary, in order to bring them up to the required stand-
ard of articles published in the PROCEEDINGS—the cost, if any, to
be deducted from the compensation due the author.
Contributors are requested to observe the following special in-
structions in preparing articles for the PROCEEDINGS:
(a) In writing names of ships put only the initial letters in
capitals and underscore the names. The underscoring sig.
nifies to the printer that the word is to be in italics. The
same applies to names of publications. Foreign words not
anglicized should also be italicized.
(b) In preparing tables and computations employing fractions,
sub-numbers, etc., do by hand that part which cannot be
made perfectly clear by the typewriter.
(c) In typing the script use double space between lines.
(d) When a quotation is included in an article the editor should
be assured by appropriate notation that the writer has care-
fully verified the quotation as presented,
Discussion of articles published in the PROCEED-
Discussions Ings is cordially invited. Discussions accepted
for publication are paid for at approximately
one-half the rate for original articles.
Book
Reviews
As soon as practicable after the publication of books
on subjects of professional interest, the Institute
aims to publish authoritative reviews of them.

It Was The Idea Of Progress That
Brought The Naval Institute
Into Being
Columbus was a dreamer—but behind his dreams there was a
definite practical purpose. The wealth of Cathay, the spices and
perfumes of the East Indies were at the feet of the man to dis-
cover a new route to those lands. Intense study and a logical
process of reasoning had convinced Columbus that this planet upon
which we live is round. His was a mind years in advance of his
times. It was difficult to convince men of the soundness of his
project and the means for the accomplishment of his dream were
impossible to obtain for a long period. But, it was his idea which
gave this man the unbounded courage and untiring perseverance
to accomplish a quest even greater than that which he had
anticipated.
It was this idea of seeing beyond the times that led to the
organization of the Naval Institute. In the Navy, perhaps, more
than in any other profession, men with vision and far-sightedness
are needed. It is only by study, exchange of ideas, and an ability
to impart our ideas to others that any progress is made. For this
reason the Naval Institute has, through the publication of its
PROCEEDINGS, always encouraged officers to think along naval lines
and helped them to present their ideas to the Navy in a suitable
form. Articles in the PROCEEDINGS have been forerunners of
many of the great improvements in our Navy. But Progress
demands that we never stand still. The Naval Institute dreams
of greater advancement in years to come.
To accomplish the maximum amount of good it is desired that
every officer in the Navy be a member of the Naval Institute and
a subscriber to the PROCEEDINGS. To advance with one's pro-
fession one must keep acquainted with every move in that pro-
fession. The Naval Institute offers to officers of the Navy the
simplest method of doing this. The annual membership dues are
$3.00 (including subscription to the PROCEEDINGS). A check
payable to the Secretary of the Naval Institute, Annapolis, Mary-
land, will bring immediate attention.
The above was written by Midshipman (now Ensign) Harry Wagner of
the class of 1925, U.S.N.A., who won first prize for the most acceptable
advertisement for the Naval Institute to appear in the 1925 Lucky Bag.
The Lucky Bag staff, ineligible in the contest, determined the prize winner.
