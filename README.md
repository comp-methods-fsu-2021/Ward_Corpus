# Scope

My dissertation project is documenting and contrasting the war-time experience of different ship types of the US Navy in World War II.  For instance, a destroyer had the potential to perform many different types of mission from surface combat, to concoy escort, anti-submarine patrol, and screening of larger formations where an fleet type aircraft carrier only perfromed strategic and tactical strike missions as part of a large fleet organization.  How did these different mission types impact the experience of the crews and the relationship between these crews.  Another ascpect is the vessel crew and airwing crew on an aircraft carrier.  The air wing was routinely rotated to training or stateside assignments while the vessel's crew stayed on station in the active war theater.  How did this differetn wartime experience impact their relationship?

# Process for this Class

Many of the sources for my main project do not lend themselves to the aims of this class.  I have, however, found a source that discusses the fleet organization and the nascent concept of the use of aircaraft in naval operations in the inter-war years.  As a single issue, this makes this corpus a little hard to navaigate so I plan to locte each article and break it out of the main txt file and create a file for each individual piece.

# Cleaning

Showing my age and my less than enthusiastic affinity to new, electronic methods I struggle with plain text editing and do not grasp why I would use it. The source I have chosen for this project is relatively clean already and I can understand it just fine as is. Cleaning with Sublime is a laborious process for me but I am starting to see some small success. The largest area for a little clean up was the page breaks denoted by a long string of #'s which I have no reduced to just one and the page number itself. Other than that I do not see much more cleaning needing to be done.
