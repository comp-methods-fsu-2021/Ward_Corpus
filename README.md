Cleaning

Showing my age and my less than enthusiastic affinity to new, electronic methods I struggle with plain text editing and do not grasp why I would use it. The source I have chosen for this project is relatively clean already and I can understand it just fine as is. Cleaning with Sublime is a laborious process for me but I am starting to see some small success. The largest area for a little clean up was the page breaks denoted by a long string of #'s which I have no reduced to just one and the page number itself. Other than that I do not see much more cleaning needing to be done.
