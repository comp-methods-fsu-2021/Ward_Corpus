NATIONAL STRATEGY
By LIEUTENANT COMMANDER H. H. Frost, U. S. Navy
Motto: “War is the sum of all the forces and pressures operative at a
given period."
CHURCHILL.
I. War and National Strategy.---War is the weighing of our
national capacity to exert and resist pressure against that of the
enemy nation or nations.
A war is decided when the national strength or the will to con-
quer of one of the opposing nations or alliances breaks. As there
is no nation, however strong or powerful, whose national strength
will not break if subjected to severe enough pressure for a suffi-
cient period of time, it is necessary that we bring the enemy nation
to the breaking strain before our own nation reaches it.
Due to the very great strain to which the economic forces of a
nation are subjected by modern war, it is not only necessary to
win, but it is extremely desirable to win with as little economic
effort and as quickly as possible. This expenditure of eco-
nomic effort makes such inroads upon our economic strength that
usually many years are required for recovery and sometimes, as
in the World War, the victors are reduced to practically the same
ruinous economic condition as the vanquished. This would not
have been the case had the war been decided in 1915 or 1916. In
addition to economic disaster, a long war similarly makes grave
attacks upon the moral strength of a nation and produces that
unrest and instability, which, after the World War, was as serious
a problem as economic recovery.
In his analysis as to why the allied powers, with their great
superiority of men and resources, did not win except through the
exhaustion of their enemies, Churchill strikes to the root of the
matter. "War,” he says, “which knows no rigid divisions between
French, Russian and British Allies, between Land, Sea and Air,

between gaining victories and alliances, between supplies and fight-
ing men, between propaganda and machinery, which is, in fact,
simply the sum of all forces and pressures operative at a given
period, was dealt with piecemeal.”
To break the moral power of the enemy nation, our government
should direct the operations of the following forces against similar
enemy forces in the combinations best designed for exerting and
resisting pressure:
a) The armed forces, including the military and naval services.
b) The economic forces, including the mining and manufactur-
ing industries, the transportation, communication, financial, com-
mercial and agricultural systems, the scientific organizations and
other similar national institutions.
c) The political forces, including the diplomatic service, the
news, publishing, educational and religious systems and the social,
political, labor and fraternal organizations.
These various forces must be used in the most effective com-
binations and along the most advantageous lines in order to exert
the greatest concentrated national pressure upon the enemy nation
and at the same time to raise to the maximum our national capacity
to resist his pressure.
This offensive and defensive use of our armed, economic and
political forces in proper coordination may be called national
strategy, and a thorough knowledge of this subject is the secret
which will win the next war.
National strategy is one of the most difficult and complex of sub-
jects because every action in war of our armed, economic and
political forces affects all the activities of our own and the enemy
nation, and even neutral countries, in a manner and to a degree that
it is practically impossible to estimate in advance with even ap-
proximate accuracy. This interplay of forces with its tremendous
influences upon the course of the entire war is a subject which will
be well worthy of the most careful consideration by our economic
and political leaders, as well as by our military and naval
services.
II. The Development of National Strategy.-National strategy
has changed greatly during the last two centuries. Formerly, the
armed forces played by far the most important part in war, while

1345
National Strategy
the requirements of the economic and political forces were com-
paratively simple. This was due to the following facts:
a) Both army and navy could then more generally decide a
campaign by battle.
b) But little material was required for the armed forces, and
the principal economic force employed was money, for which
everything, even soldiers and political power, could be bought.
c) Most governments were autocratic and public opinion had
little force. The political forces were therefore small and nations
were influenced by gaining the favor or hatred of a few powerful
persons.
The growth of the modern form of national strategy commenced
with the wars of the French Revolution, was further developed by
the German general staff, and reached its present form in the
World War.
The principal changes in national strategy are the greatly in-
creased importance of the economic and political forces, which,
however, are still distinctly less important than the armed forces.
These changes are due to the following:
a) The technical developments which have favored defensive
tactics on both land and sea to such an extent that it is becoming
more and more difficult to decide a campaign by battle without
first weakening the enemy forces by other forms of pressure.
b) The great increase in the amount of material required by
the armed forces, which requires a corresponding development of
the economic forces.
c) The increased importance of public opinion, which requires
a great upbuilding of political forces, including propaganda sys-
tems, to influence it as well as governmental opinion.
III. Uses of the Armed Forces.-In considering the operations
of the armed forces, they can be divided into three classes, accord-
ing as their primary mission affects :
a) The armed forces of the enemy nation or nations.
b) The economic forces of the nations at war.
c) The political forces of the warring and neutral nations.
Usually, in order to exert the greatest pressure upon all parts
of the enemy nation and to resist its pressure upon us, it is de-


  p. 1346 (#264)                      #

1346
(Aug.
U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
sirable to use our armed forces simultaneously in all three of these
main forms of operations. In order, however, to simplify the con-
duct of operations, no particular military, naval or combined force
should be given more than one primary mission. As, however,
every use of our armed forces has widespread influences through-
out the warring and neutral nations, the execution of this mission
usually either automatically or incidentally accomplishes other pur-
poses or tends favorably toward their accomplishment. It is
therefore important, when assigning a primary mission to any task
force, to see if it cannot be so drawn as to permit the operations
of the force to have other favorable influences, which, in some
cases, may be almost as important as the execution of the primary
mission itself. Thus, assuming that the primary mission assigned
von Mackensen for his Serbian campaign of 1915 was the destruc-
tion of the Serbian Army, his operations were so designed as to
accomplish economic and political results perhaps even more im-
portant.
IV. Operations Against the Enemy Armed Forces.—The first
and most important class of operations to be carried on by our
armed forces is strictly military or naval. Our object is to exert
directly the maximum pressure upon the armed forces of the
enemy and to resist that of the enemy armed forces upon ours.
The armed forces are therefore pitted directly against each other
and fight their campaigns to a finish regardless of economic or
political considerations. We think of nothing but fighting and of
inflicting such losses of personnel and material on enemy forces
that we will gain the moral ascendency over them. If this is our
purpose and we wish to accomplish it as quickly as possible it fol-
lows that we should seek out the largest enemy forces to destroy.
We must, therefore, collect the most powerful units of our forces
to accomplish this purpose.
This results in the principal military forces of a nation being
formed into field armies, which have their fronts covered by vari-
ous advanced troops attached to the armies for the purpose of
obtaining information of the enemy and to prevent him from ob-
taining information of our forces. These advanced troops rejoin
the main bodies of the field armies before a battle in order to bring
all of our available forces against the enemy in a concentrated
mass.

National Strategy
In exactly the same way the principal naval forces are formed
into a battle fleet, which likewise has its front covered by advanced
forces, which we call the scouting fleet, to perform the same duties
as the advanced forces of the field armies. They likewise join the
battle fleet before an action. The battle and scouting fleets are
both equal subdivisions of the United States fleet and operate
directly under its commander-in-chief.
A field army, with its advanced forces, takes for its primary
mission the complete defeat of the enemy field army. A battle
fleet, assisted by its scouting fleet, takes for its primary mission
the decisive defeat of the enemy battle fleet.
V. The Campaign of the Field Army.—Where two nations at
war have common land boundaries, the military forces, and in par-
ticular the field armies, are usually the principal instruments of
warfare. Their primary mission is the decisive defeat of the
enemy field armies. In modern history this principle developed
from the rapid and decisive purely military victories of Napoleon
and Moltke. A close examination of the campaigns of these great
leaders will show:
a) The opposing forces were usually greatly inferior in either
numbers, efficiency or leadership.
b) The technical developments favored offensive tactics, par-
ticularly in the Napoleonic wars.
c) Little or no use was made of permanent or field fortifica-
tions.
d) The forces were too small to form a continuous front.
Where these conditions have not been present rapid and purely
military decisions have seldom been the rule. Even in ancient his-
tory this principle was applicable, for, in contrast to Alexander's
rapid successes, we see Sparta and Athens fighting for thirty
years; Pyrrhus engaging Rome for nine years, and, finally, Han-
nibal holding his grip on Southern Italy for fifteen years, and even
then only relaxing it to defend Carthage.
In the long wars for Dutch independence, due to the equality
between the opposing armies in numbers, efficiency and leadership,
and the extensive use of permanent fortifications, there developed
a military deadlock which was almost exactly similar to that of the

1348

western front. The victory of the Dutch was due to their naval
victories and the consequent attacks on Spanish trade.
In the Thirty Years War the principal weapon, after the death
of Gustavus, was hunger; and in the prolonged wars of Marl-
borough and Eugene not even their great series of victories was
able to win a strictly military decision.
In the Seven Years War the genius of Frederick and the effi-
ciency of his armies were balanced against the superior numbers
of the enemy coalition; in the end it was only political events which
allowed him to retain his hold on Silesia and obtain an even break
after seven years of continuous fighting.
Our Civil War resulted in another protracted struggle in which
economic pressure, exerted through the Navy, greatly assisted our
field armies in winning their decision.
Before the World War von der Goltz predicted that "it was ab-
solutely certain that in a future war events would not march with
anything like the rapidity" of the campaigns of 1866 and 1870.
While it might have been possible for the Germans to have gained
a decisive military success in the French campaign of 1914, this
is now beginning to appear more and more doubtful. Two great
armies, when their morale is unbroken, tend to reach a state of
equilibrium. As an army advances its numbers and equipment
decrease and friction and exhaustion reduce its effectiveness. A
retreating army, as long as its morale remains unbroken, increases
its numbers and equipment by throwing in its reserves and has
all the technical advantages of the defensive. Even admitting
German mistakes the allied armies in any event must have been
considerably superior on the Marne in September, 1914, in both
numbers and equipment, in addition to having the advantage of
resting their flanks on the two great fortresses of Verdun and
Paris. For these reasons it is beginning to appear more and more
improbable that the Germans could have decided the war in 1914.
Admiral von Tirpitz seems to have sensed this at the time and
recommended that the Channel ports be seized early in the advance.
While it is believed that the Germans were correct in endeavoring
to destroy the French Army, still, as it actually resulted, it would
have been advantageous for them had they followed his suggestion.
Once the lines were established on the western front, the in-
creased value of the defensive allowed greatly inferior forces con-

National Strategy
tinually to throw back the great allied offensives of 1915 with far
greater losses to the attackers than the defenders. The allied
losses, as stated by Churchill, were often twice and sometimes
three times as great as the German.
In February, 1916, the Germans returned to the offensive in a
particularly well-conceived operation. We are coming to see that
the Battle of Verdun was one of the most effective, if not the most
effective, of the offensive actions on the western front prior to
1918. A leading allied authority admits that the Germans came
within a reasonable distance of winning a decision and that it at
least saved the situation for them on the western front by breaking
up the great combined offensive planned on twice the scale of the
Somme Battle. While it adversely affected the morale of both
armies, as do all battles of attrition, it undoubtedly reduced that
of the French far more than that of the enemy. Finally, it is
admitted that the French losses were probably in excess of the
German, an usual feature of an offensive battle of attrition, due
to the favorable tactical position of the Germans. Nevertheless,
the failure of the Germans to win a decision, combined with the
break-through of the Russians, caused the retirement of General
von Falkenhayn.
The real effects of the Somme offensive will never be decided.
The British claim that it did much to break the morale of the Ger-
man soldier. Ludendorff freely admits the anxiety with which he
watched the course of the battle and it is perfectly true that his
army was reduced to a dangerous condition, but with an inferiority
on the western front of five to nine this was to be expected, con-
sidering the fact that his troops had already fought a heavy action
at Verdun and that he was being attacked by a greatly superior
force of fresh troops with an extraordinarily heavy artillery sup-
port. Even at that, his tired troops were able to hold up for
moderate gains the British attack of September 15, which was
made in good weather with a four to one superiority of infantry,
a more numerous artillery, practical supremacy of the air, the
advantage of using the tank as a surprise weapon and the ability
to exploit initial successes by means of a great mass of cavalry.
In the midst of the action Ludendorff was able to spare four of
his divisions for the eastern front.

But if Ludendorff was compelled to admit that his army was
completely exhausted at the end of the year and that its fighting
power had decreased, on the other hand the French and British
political leaders had lost all confidence in their military leaders.
Joffre and Foch were relieved from command at the front; Haig
was placed under the direction of the new and inexperienced
French commander. “No more Sommes," was the watchword of
the allied politicians.
For 1917 the plan on the western front was for the British to
make a powerful preliminary attack in front of Arras, while
Nivelle broke through along the Aisne. The first British attacks
proved excellent and drew German reserves, but Nivelle's great
attack broke down completely; he was dismissed; Petain was
brought in to restore the broken morale of the troops and the
word was issued to limit all operations to local attacks. In the
meantime the Battle of Arras died down with several costly re-
pulses, having achieved no strategical objectives.
So costly was the effect of the French failure that Ludendorff
was able to send six divisions from the western to the eastern front
where they played an important part in the great counter-attack in
July.
In June the British carried out the completely successful local
operation at Messines as a prelude to their Flanders offensive.
The effects of this terrific battle of attrition, like those of the
Somme, will always be a matter for argument. Again the Ger-
mans were practicaly exhausted and could withdraw only four divi-
sions from the western front for their Fourteenth Army at
Caporetto. On the other hand, the British politicans would not
provide the drafts to make up the enormous wastage of their divi-
sions and this was largely responsible for their defeats the next
spring. A member of the government, when informed that more
men were needed in France, replied "But when we find the men
they are lost." This feeling led the politicians to send the available
troops to Mesopotamia or Palestine, where they could have no
effect on the course of the war, in 1918 at least, or to retain them
in England.
The attack and counterattack at Cambrai showed that attacks
were becoming more effective, due to the thinning of the battle
lines, the exhaustion and moral breakdown of units, and also to

1925]
1351
National Strategy
improved methods of attack. The French proved that carefully
planned local attacks could almost always be carried through suc-
cessfully, but their actions had no strategical effect.
The operations of 1918 showed the exhaustion of the opposing
armies and the greater possibilities of the attack under the more
favorable conditions. In the actions of March 21 and May 27 the
Germans were able to break through and exploit their successes
to a most unexpected degree but could not gain a decision. It was
their last throw. Political and economic weaknesses, together
with the arrival of over 2,000,000 fresh troops on the western
front, were the underlying causes of their downfall. Notable ex-
ploits of the allied leaders and troops contributed to the result.
The German Empire slowly collapsed under the finely coordinated
operations of the armed, economic and political forces of the allies.
On the eastern front the greater lengths of the battle lines 're-
duced the density with which the front could be held and gave the
attacker far more chance of success. Russian superiority in num-
bers and the incomparable bravery of their troops could not
counterbalance German superiority in leadership, efficiency and
material; but even then the Germans, despite great tactical vic-
tories, could not win a strategical decision. Although they did
exert most powerful military pressure on Russia, her collapse was
due to political and economic effects as much as military defeats.
As an example, Ludendorff, at the request of the German Chan-
cellor, suppressed the news of the German victory on the Stochod
in April, 1917. Although this victory showed the weakness of the
enemy, he forbade for some time any attacks on the Russians for
political reasons, and authorized the preparations for the final
attack of July only when it became apparent that the Russians re-
quired one more military defeat.
On the Italian front an overwhelming military success, itself
effected largely by propaganda, could not win a decision, although
it reestablished the Austrian Army and compelled the French and
British to stiffen the Italian front with eleven divisions at the
expense of a more important theater.
It was only where a lesser power, Belgium, Serbia, or Roumania,
was attacked that a purely military decision could be won, although
even here brilliant leadership was usually necessary to supplement
superior resources.

From the above facts it may be deduced that when a great power
is at war with a small power it will probably still be possible to
win a purely military decision by destroying the enemy field
armies; but when great nations are at war with approximately
equal military forces it will seldom be possible to win a purely
military decision.
In any case, it would appear to be the correct policy to strike
first with full force in the attempt to win a rapid military decision
before the fronts are stabilized. Failing to accomplish this, we
should then endeavor to form our battle lines as far to the front
as possible in order to secure, to use a naval term, the control of
the greatest possible amount of enemy territory and to confine the
operations of the enemy field armies to as restricted areas as pos-
sible, denying him, insofar as possible, areas of industrial and
economic importance. It is interesting to note that this is how
Frederick, in 1778, said he would act if he ever had to fight again.
We should then carry out such offensive operations as may be
possible in order to wear down the enemy by constant pressure and
limited offensives, but only in such tactical situations that the rela-
tive losses, both moral and material, will be to our advantage. We
must always be ready to seize the opportunity for an attack in
full force whenever the opposing field armies have been so re-
duced in physical and moral strength that there is a good prospect
of decisive success.
VI. The Campaign of the Battle Fleet.—Where the two op-
posing nations have no common land boundaries, the navy will
usually be the principal instrument of warfare, particularly in the
first stages of the war. As in military strategy, it is naturally
desirable to endeavor first to defeat the main forces of the hostile
navy. For this purpose the most powerful units, supported by all
of the smaller units necessary for fighting a fleet action, are formed
into a battle fleet. The duties of the advanced forces in scouting
and screening for such a fleet are so varied and important as to
warrant the formation of a scouting fleet which, in our Navy, op-
erates directly under the commander-in-chief of the United States
fleet. Our battle fleet, assisted by the scouting fleet, endeavors to
locate, bring to action and destroy the enemy battle fleet ; but if
at certain periods of history the decisive defeat of the enemy field
army has been a difficult accomplishment, that of the battle fleet


  p. 1353 (#271)                      #

1925)
1353
National Strategy
has been even more so. This is due to the special circumstances of
naval warfare which allow an enemy fleet to decline action by re-
maining in a defended port or so close to it that an assured line
of retirement is always available. This means that a fleet action
could take place only:
a) When both fleets were willing to fight, or
b) One was lured to sea and its retreat cut off, or
c) It was forced out of port by pressure other than that exerted
by our battle fleet.
Due to these facts, fleet actions have rarely occurred, and of
these very few have been decisive. Such as have been, were won
over very inferior opponents and even then only after protracted
campaigns. They have not generally had the same immediate
effect upon the course of the war as great military victories which
have permitted the occupation of enemy countries, but their ulti-
mate effects have been almost as decisive.
The ability of an inferior fleet to avoid action has been increased
by the latest developments :
a) Due to the use of torpedoes, mines and smoke screens by
special vessels, it is easier for a fleet to decline, or even to dis-
engage itself, from action.
b) The use of large numbers of submarines and aircraft renders
it more dangerous to attack an inferior fleet in its own waters.
Nevertheless, despite these difficulties, the importance of de-
cisively defeating the enemy battle feet is so great that every
opportunity for action should be seized; in addition, we must en-
deavor in every possible way to bring about and force such oppor-
tunities, which must not be missed just because all the conditions
are not in our favor. These opportunities occur so seldom to a
superior fleet that they should be regarded as absolutely priceless
and distinctly unfavorable battle conditions should be accepted if
necessary.
If an opportunity does not occur to destroy the enemy battle
fleet and cannot be forced at present by any means in our power,
we must then act along the same lines as a field army which is
unable to gain a decision on land. Our battle fleet, assisted by the
scouting fleet, should push its front as far toward the enemy coasts
as it can be maintained in order to secure the control of the great-


  p. 1354 (#272)                      #

1354
(Aug.
U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
est extent of sea area possible, in particular that through which
lines of transportation vital to us and the enemy run, and to con-
fine the enemy battle fleet, and, as far as possible, his scouting
fleet, to restricted areas off his own coast or bases, our scouting
fleet and battle fleet taking such dispositions that similar enemy
fleets can initiate important operations outside this restricted area
only with the probability of decisive defeat. In addition, we must
wear down the strength of the enemy battle and scouting fleets
with our light forces, defeat enemy detachments whenever they
come within reach and sweep at irregular intervals through the
area normally controlled by the enemy in the hope of making op-
portunities of inflicting losses on the enemy, as in the action of
Heligoland Bight. And, most of all, we can never know when the
unexpected opportunity to win a decisive victory will be presented
and accordingly we must be ready at all times to seize with the
utmost energy and aggressiveness this heaven-sent opportunity of
ending the campaign.
VII. Cooperation Between the Field Army and the Battle
Fleet.— Usually the field armies and the battle fleet carry on dis-
tinct and separate campaigns, cooperation between them being car-
ried on through the medium of secondary forces. Even when the
war plans are drawn in this way the campaigns of the field army
and battle fleet should be so coordinated that each will give the
other the maximum indirect support. In some cases the battle
ficet, even when operating separately from the field army, should
take for its primary mission the support or assistance of the field
army. It is considered that the high seas fleet had a great oppor-
tunity to assist the German Army during the campaign in France
of 1914. Had it made a threat toward the Channel or the British
coast, or fought even an indecisive action with the grand fleet, it
is very possible that the despatch of the British Expeditionary
Force to France would have been postponed for some time; had
even a partial victory been won over the grand fleet the sailing of
the expedition might have been definitely cancelled. Again, in
1918 the German scouting groups of battle and light cruisers
might have been able to hold up the sailings of our troop convoys
for several weeks by operations in the Atlantic. While these
groups would eventually have suffered heavy losses their sacrifice
might have had decisive effects on the fighting in France. These

1355
National Strategy
operations of the German naval forces had probably greater
chances of influencing the land campaign than in 1914, for in 1918
both armies were at their breaking strains; the Germans, having
greater reserve power, would have won could our reinforcements
of fresh troops have been even temporarily delayed.
In the same way it is conceivable that a field army should take
for its primary mission the assistance of the battle fleet; if Gen-
eral Nogi's siege detachment be considered a field army we would
have an example of this at Port Arthur. One of the most impor-
tant objects of the costly Flanders offensive in 1917 was the cap-
ture of the Belgian bases; this would have greatly assisted the
British anti-submarine forces and, indirectly, the grand fleet.
In some campaigns the field army and battle fleet will work in
direct conjunction; this is particularly the case where a field army.
attempts to carry through an oversea invasion. Notable examples
are Parma's attempt to invade England in 1588, Napoleon's similar
attempt in 1805, and the Japanese operations in their wars with
China in 1894 and Russia in 1904.
In such campaigns it is believed that either the army or naval
commander should exercise the supreme command, depending
upon the service which has the paramount interest in the actual
operation in progress. This commander should have the power
to assign the tasks for the other service, but not the methods of
execution. This idea has been fully explained by Captain Pye.
As the operations carried on by the combined forces change in
character, the supreme command changes from one service to
another in accordance with which has the paramount interest.
VIII. Operations of the Detached and Control Forces.In
addition to the vessels composing the battle and scouting fleets
there are usually available numerous other more or less obsolete
naval vessels or converted merchant vessels which are not suitable
for use in these organizations. Thus, at the beginning of the
war, Great Britain had a great number of second line vessels, such
as battleships and cruisers, and first line destroyers and sub-
marines; great numbers of merchant vessels were also available
for conversion. These vessels were therefore used for important
subsidiary operations. Sometimes these operations assumed such
importance that first line units-Queen Elizabeth, Princess Royal,
Invincible and Inflexible—were detached from the grand fleet for

U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
long periods. In addition, many vessels were constructed especially
for subsidiary operations, particularly monitors and anti-sub-
marine craft.
In the same way, the British had considerable forces of Indian
and South African troops and other partly trained organizations
which were not suitable for use in France. These forces were
therefore used for subsidiary operations and, in fact, these cam-
paigns often became so important that good first line troops were
used in them.
In the Navy we call these secondary forces "control forces,"
because they “exercise” the control of the sea after the battle and
scouting fleets have "secured” this control. Such military forces
will be called, for want of a better name, “detached forces.”
Sometimes these forces may comprise an entire service, as:
a) When the enemy has no battle feet, as in our Civil War.
b) When the enemy's battle fleet has been destroyed, as after
Quiberon Bay, Trafalgar, or the Battle of the Sea of Japan.
c) When we have not sufficient naval forces to form a battle
fleet which would have any chance of operating successfully
against the enemy battle fleet, as in the Revolutionary War and
the War of 1812.
d) When the enemy field army has been completely defeated,
but further pressure is required to bring the enemy to terms, as in
the French occupation of the Ruhr.
e) When we are unable to form a field army of sufficient size
to engage in a land campaign against the enemy field armies, as
was the case of England in the Seven Years War, when the troops
were used for diversions.
When there is a deadlock between the opposing field armies and
battle fleets, as in the World War, it is the efficient use of the de-
tached and control forces which will decide the issue of the war.
They are the reserves which may be thrown in on the fighting,
economic or political fronts in accordance with our estimate as to
where they can be used with the greatest effect. There will always
be such a variety of demands made for their use, and such in-
numerable combinations can be made with them that their skillful
use is a problem more difficult and complex than the comparatively
narrow and strictly military or naval problems of the field army
and the battle fleet.

The first and most natural use of our detached and control
forces is to assist directly our field army and battle fleet in winning
their campaigns. There are times when a certain detachment of
the control forces, having accomplished its mission, may be with-
drawn to the battle fleet, as were the Princess Royal, Invincible
and Inflexible after the Falklands action. Also, sometimes the
operation in which the detachment is engaged develops so un-
successfully that it must be abandoned; in this case the forces
engaged in it may be withdrawn to the battle fleet or field army, as
were the Queen Elizabeth and the Anzacs from the Gallipoli
campaign.
Sometimes our control or detached forces may be within sup-
porting distance of our battle fleet or field army when a decisive
battle is being fought. In such cases they should forget their pres-
ent duty, march to the sound of the guns and intervene with their
full power. This is what Tyrwhitt wished to do at Jutland. The
Germans ordered all their submarines to the scene of action.
As both branches of the armed forces must be considered as
one instrument for waging war, it is important that each should
furnish the other constant mutual support. We have seen that
in some cases the field army and battle fleet work in direct con-
junction, but it is principally the naval control forces which are
most suitable for affording direct support to the field army and the
detached military forces which can best assist the battle fleet in its
campaign.
These supporting forces may be given more or less permanently
to the other service or may be loaned for a limited period. They
may be placed directly under the orders of the other service or
merely directed to cooperate as may be practicable. In some cases
the supporting forces may be very small; in others they may be
very powerful, as was Nogi's siege detachment at Port Arthur.
The decision as to whether forces of one service should be given
to the other depends upon an estimate as to whether these forces
will be able to contribute more to the operations of our entire
armed forces by acting in conjunction with the other service than
with other forces of its own service. The maintenance of good
feeling between the two services and the moral support afforded
are important considerations which favor a general policy of
mutual support wherever possible.

IX. Support of the Field Army by the Naval Control Forces.
-The field army may be supported by the navy in several ways:
a) By the transfer of naval or marine units to the field army.
b) By giving the army naval guns and other equipment with or
without personnel.
c) By assisting military operations by artillery fire from ships.
d) By safely transporting the field army and its supplies to the
theater of operations.
The siege of Antwerp brought into action the naval and marine
units of three nations. A German naval division was probably
the most reliable unit of von Beseler's siege detachment, while one
British brigade of marines and two of seamen contributed some-
what to the prolongation of the defense. A French force of 8,000
marines under Rear Admiral Ronarc'h was enroute to Antwerp,
but, failing to arrive in time, distinguished itself at Dixmude,
where it lost eighty per cent of its strength.
All the field armies were greatly assisted by the navies in the
supply of long range guns and other equipment. Early in the
war the British Navy organized considerable forces of armored
trains, armored cars, and aircraft which operated from the Channel
ports against the forces covering the right flank of the German
army. After the fall of Antwerp all these forces were given to
General Rawlinson. The British Navy was also largely instru-
mental in developing the tank and the methods of using poison
gases. As early as January, 1915, Sir John French urgently re-
quested the use of the 15-inch howitzers being prepared by the
Navy. Rear Admiral von Usedom, in command of the coast de-
fenses of the Dardanelles, furnished large numbers of howitzers
and guns to supplement the weak artillery of the Fifth Turkish
Army defending the Gallipoli Peninsula. The German Navy fur-
nished the naval guns from which the long range guns for the
bombardment of Paris were built. Our Navy supported the field
army with a battery of five 14-inch railway guns.
On a number of occasions the guns of naval vessels have fur-
nished excellent artillery support for the field army, particularly in
the operations along the Belgian coast in the fall of 1914 before
the Germans had been able to develop their powerful coast defense
batteries.

The British Navy played an extremely important part in the
assembly of the field army from Great Britain, Australia and
Canada on the western front and later the British and United
States Navies performed a similar duty in transporting our army
to France. The actual transportation of the troops is a duty of
the naval transportation service, but the escort and protection of
the troops and supplies enroute is a function of the control forces.
X. Support of the Battle Fleet by Detached Military Forces.
--Assistance of the battle fleet by detached forces will usually take
the following lines:
a) The use of an expeditionary force to seize and hold bases
for the fleet.
b) The attack of an expeditionary force or siege detachment
upon the base of the enemy battle fleet in order to force it to sea.
c) The intervention of shore based aircraft in an action between
battle fleets.
Due to the fact that both battle fleets operated from their home
bases, there were no instances of expeditionary forces seizing
bases for them in the World War. Unfortunately, the British
plan to seize Borkum for an advanced base was abandoned after
the declaration of war. This form of operations, however, is of
well recognized importance in an oversea campaign.
The campaign of Shafter's army against Santiago and Nogi's
army against Port Arthur were both directed primarily against
the hostile fleets in those ports. In the first case the fleet was
forced to sea and destroyed; in the second it was partly broken
up in the action of August 10 and finally destroyed by the guns of
the Japanese siege detachment. The attacks of the Italians on the
Isonzo front were, partly directed at the Austrian battle fleet in
Pola.
In future campaigns shore-based aircraft, particularly fighting
and bombing planes, attached to either the army or navy, will be of
great assistance should an enemy battle fleet venture into an area
which can be reached by large numbers of such planes, either by
intervening in a feet action or by wearing down the enemy's
strength by unsupported attacks. The shore based air forces
within their radius of action will usually be superior to any which
can be flown from ships, and this fact, together with the increased

effectiveness of the submarines, practically prohibits an attack in
force on the coast of a powerful nation. This, however, has sel-
dom been a practicable operation and is not necessary for winning
the decision in a naval campaign; other methods of using a naval
force to exert strong pressure on the enemy, such as reduction of
outlying possessions and economic blockade, are practicable with-
out bringing our battle fleet within range of the main air forces
of the enemy.
XI. Indirect Support of the Field Army and Battle Fleet by
Secondary Forces. In addition to directly supporting the field
army and battle fleet the detached and control forces may afford
indirect support by operating along separate lines, the forces not
being attached to the field army or battle fleet or operating in con-
junction with them. These operations take the following forms:
a) Destruction of forces separated or detached from the field
army or battle feet.
b) Diversions to weaken the enemy field army or battle fleet.
c) Attacks by light forces on the enemy battle fleet.
Most of these operations require the closest cooperation between
the two services and by means of them each service can utilize its
excess forces to assist the other service. In many cases combined
military and naval forces can be used most effectively. A general
practice should be made of detailing forces, even very small ones,
from one service to the other, because such forces usually will be
able to afford support out of all proportion to their own strength.
The Dardanelles and Mesopotamian campaigns show this coopera-
tion between the two services in its best form.
XII. Destruction of Isolated Detachments.—Often in war,
portions of the enemy forces become separated from their field
army or battle feet in such situations that we may organize special
forces to destroy them.
In naval warfare opportunities to attack isolated enemy forces
occur most frequently at its beginning before the enemy has time
to concentrate his forces. In 1904 the Japanese were able to
destroy a light cruiser and gunboat at Chemulpo and to isolate
a cruiser division in Vladivostok, thus weakening the Russian
battle fleet based on Port Arthur. In 1914 the British had an op-
portunity to destroy the Goeben and Breslau and thus weaken the
high seas fleet by the loss of two important units.

National Strategy
In land warfare the opportunity to destroy detached forces oc-
curs most frequently when portions of the field army are left
behind to assist in the defense of fortresses. There were numerous
examples of this in the World War and in 1870 Bazaine's entire
field army was swept into and destroyed at Metz. This form of
operations has a number of advantages:
a) It reduces the forces available to the enemy field army and
battle fleet. The German naval forces on foreign station at the
beginning of the war-one battle cruiser, two cruisers, seven light
cruisers—represented quite a reinforcement for the high seas feet.
In the same way the heavy losses in prisoners and guns occasioned
by the fall of fortresses reduced the strength of the field armies.
b) Such successes are usually assured, due to our superiority
of force, and are often cheaply bought, due to the enemy's knowl-
edge that ultimate victory is practically impossible. There are,
however, some notable exceptions, such as the famous sieges of
Ostend, Genoa and Port Arthur and the remarkable defense of
German East Africa, one of the great exploits of history.
c) Important military or naval advantages will often be gained,
particularly in opening up and securing lines of communication
and transportation, as at Liege and the Falklands action.
d) Economic and political advantages may be gained, as at
Tsingtau.
These operations, however, have the serious disadvantage that
they usually require a superiority of force and to carry them out
we may be compelled to weaken our more essential forces at a
critical time. Where the operation can be quickly decided, such
a weakening of our main forces is justifiable, especially if the
secret is well kept. The Germans did not know that two battle
cruisers had been detached from the grand feet until the results of
the Falklands action were announced and they probably never
knew of the detachment of the Princess Royal. However, if
Sturdee had not had such extraordinary luck in meeting von Spee
so quickly, the loss to the grand fleet of three important first line
units for a protracted period would have been a somewhat serious
one. In some circumstances superiority of force is not required
in these operations. A most spectacular example was von Beseler's
capture of Antwerp with a miscellaneous collection of reserve,

Landsturm and naval units operating against a force double his in
strength and sheltered by the second strongest fortress in Europe.
XIII. Diversions.-A diversion is usually a most satisfactory
form of operation for temporarily reducing the strength of the
enemy's field army or battle fleet. First, a diversion requires only
small forces. In naval warfare even a single ship, as for example
the Emden, Karlsruhe or Moewe, can create a most successful
diversion. On November 5, 1914, the Germans had at large but
five ships, of which two were armored; to run down this force the
British were actually using about thirty ships, of which twenty-one
were armored, not counting large Japanese and French forces and
armed merchantmen. Second, our force, having the advantage of
initiative, surprise, and the choice of a large number of objectives,
can usually inflict considerable military, naval, economic and po-
litical losses on the enemy. Third, in case our force should hit a
weak spot, it can often be reinforced and changed into an impor-
tant operation, which actually happened at the Dardanelles.
Fourth, the enemy usually is required to employ greatly superior
forces to meet our attack; he must guard a great number of pos-
sible objectives and must always be ready for a repeated attack in
the same place. Fifth, a diversion does not require that our force
be successful or even heavily engaged, although, of course, its
results will be greater if this be the case. Diversions may be
made by:
a) Military forces, as in the Turkish attack on the Suez Canal
and that against the Persian oil fields.
b) Naval forces, as in the first attack on the Dardanelles and
the Ostend operation of August, 1914.
c) Combined forces, as in the attacks on Rochefort and Cher-
bourg in the Seven Years War.
The Turkish attack on the Suez Canal, although made by very
small forces which failed most completely in their attempt to in-
jure the canal, was really a most successful diversion, largely be-
cause of the great importance of its objective. This induced the
British to retain large forces in Egypt and to undertake the highly
unprofitable Palestine campaign, tying down for several years an
army, which ultimately reached 270,000 men, exclusive of fol-
lowers, while the Turkish Army was a fraction of this figure. In

National Strategy
:
the same way a small force of Turks and Arabs attacked the Brit-
ish oil fields in Persia and the pipe lines along the Karun River;
this drew two gunboats and an entire brigade.
The first stage of the Dardanelles attack actually was designed
to create a diversion to assist the Russians. It succeeded in draw-
ing six Turkish divisions to the Dardanelles. While this was an
excellent diversion from the Russian viewpoint, it was not so
favorable when it was decided to change the diversion into an
attack in force.
At the end of August, 1914, the British Navy concentrated a
considerable force in Ostend and landed a brigade of 3,000 ma-
rines. This created a powerful diversion and according to General
Dupont was the culminating element in the German decision to
withdraw from the Marne.
The use of combined forces for diversions was one of the prin-
cipal elements of Pitt's strategy in the Seven Years War. The
attacks on Rochefort and Cherbourg were designed to draw off
troops from the German front and, although they had very slight
actual success, they had excellent strategical results. In the Civil
War combined federal forces at Fort Monroe drew off Long-
street's corps of 15,000 men from Lee's army and compelled him
to fight the Battle of Chancellorsville against great odds.
When an operation can at the same time crush an enemy force
and act as a diversion, it is particularly effective. One of the best
examples of this was von der Goltz's counter-attack on Town-
shend's army and its ultimate capture at Kut. Not only was a
distinct victory won, but the necessity for the British to regain
their moral losses and prestige in the East compelled them to mass
an army which ultimately grew to 280,000 troops, exclusive of
followers, to carry on a campaign whose small results were alto-
gether out of proportion to the forces used. The German-Austrian
attack on Italy in 1917 not only inflicted the heaviest losses on the
Italians, but forced the British and French to use their scanty
reserves to stiffen the Italian front to their own cost in March,
1918. Although made largely for political reasons the German-
Austrian attack on Serbia in 1915 practically destroyed the Serbian
army and drew from the western front great numbers of French
and British troops. In 1918 the army based on Salonica num-
bered, including Greeks and Serbians, 630,000 men, exclusive of

U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
followers. In addition all the equipment for the Greeks and Ser-
bians had to be furnished by the British and French, and the
Italians had to give two divisions to furnish a front in Albania.
XIV. Attacks of the Light Forces. Our control forces will
often be able to attack important units of the enemy battle and
scouting fleets. Submarines are particularly effective for such
attacks. British submarines torpedoed at various times two battle-
ships and two battle cruisers. Minelayers were also effective; the
Audacious and other important units were lost as a result of their
operations. Shore-based bombing and torpedo planes, both mili-
tary and naval, will be a constant menace to enemy forces ven-
turing near their bases.
XV. Operations Affecting the Economic Forces.—Having
considered the primary missions of our military and naval serv-
ices, that is, the decisive defeat of the enemy field army and battle
fleet, and also those operations of the detached and control forces
which are intended to assist our field army and battle fleet in their
campaigns, both directly as a part of these main forces and in-
directly in distinct and separate operations, it is now appropriate
to consider the further operations of the detached and control
forces which primarily affect the economic forces of the opposing
nations and thereby indirectly affect all the national forces. These
operations fall into three classes, according as their mission is:
a) To exert pressure on the enemy economic forces.
b) To resist the pressure of the enemy armed forces on our
economic forces.
c) To assist our economic forces.
Our armed forces are designed primarily for use against the
enemy armed forces. Their use against economic forces is an
unnatural one which must be justified by unusual conditions. Such
operations are restricted by the prevalent conception of inter-
national law and usually to be successful involve its violation in
important respects. They also often cause great suffering among
the civil population of the enemy nation and great bitterness
toward us; this will be turned to good account by the enemy. In
many cases, particularly in naval warfare, neutral lives and prop-
erty may be destroyed and this may cause powerful neutrals to
take sides with the enemy or at least assume an attitude of benev-


  p. 1365 (#283)                      #

1925)
1365
National Strategy
olent neutrality. Therefore, in deciding upon operations against
the enemy economic forces, the adverse political effect must be
accepted and steps taken in advance to counteract it.
XVI. Attacks on the Enemy Economic Forces.-In general,
direct attacks on the enemy economic forces are made when:
a) Our naval forces are unable to secure the command of the
sea by operations against the enemy battle fleet and must be used
for missions easier of attainment, in particular attacks on trade.
b) Our naval forces have secured the control of the sea by suc-
cessful operations against the enemy battle fleet, thus permitting
our control forces to exercise that control by exerting pressure on
the enemy economic forces by blockade or similar operations.
c) The enemy is unable to organize a battle fleet, thus allowing
a considerable part of our forces to be used for exerting economic
pressure by blockade.
d) Our military forces, due to the defeat of the enemy field
army, can occupy important economic centers or areas which are
vital to the enemy.
In all these forms of operations more or less contact with the
enemy armed forces must be expected, but these contacts are
merely incidental to the execution of our primary mission, the
attack of enemy economic forces.
In the World War the Germans, realizing that they could not
secure the control of the sea by operations against the grand fleet,
while continuing such operations, used their control forces to
attack the economic forces of the Allies. These attacks took the
following forms:
a) Submarine warfare, including mining, against allied and
neutral trade.
b) Cruiser warfare against trade.
c) Aircraft bombing attacks against industrial centers.
The German submarine offensive produced remarkable results,
both favorable and unfavorable. The direct influence upon the
economic forces of the Allies was so great as almost to decide the
war. These results indirectly influenced the military situation
greatly to the advantage of the Germans, but on the other hand
they had a most unfavorable political result, the entry of the
United States into the war, which in turn changed the military

(Aug
U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
situation against the Germans. The question of submarine war-
fare is a balancing of favorable economic, military and naval fac-
tors against the unfavorable political factor. While this form of
warfare was greatly criticized by those who suffered from it and
while it is formally barred by an obscure treaty, it cannot be left
out of consideration in contemplating future naval wars, because,
while such forms of warfare are distinctly out of favor in our
country, we must always count upon its use by an enemy nation, a
fact which is accepted by a leading British naval critic. History
affords no instance of a nation losing a desperate war for its
existence without using every means at its disposal to win and it
is even more doubtful if there will be such cases in the future.
Furthermore, it may be possible under special conditions, as was
the case in the Sea of Marmora, to use it in an area where there
are no neutrals or where it is unnecessary to attack without
warning.
Cruiser warfare against trade is sometimes justified on a small
scale, but more as a diversion or threat than for producing any
important actual results. A limited number of raiders should be
used, because in this way we produce a moderate economic effect,
due to delay of sailings, increase of insurance rates, and deterring
neutral ships from serving the enemy. In addition, it creates a
diversion by keeping in play a large number of enemy cruisers.
The cruises of the Emden, Karlsruhe, Mocue and I'olf are models
for such operations.
The actual effects of the air attacks on industrial centers is
still difficult to estimate. During the war the Allies refused to
admit that any economic or military damage had been done. Dis-
closures since the war tend to show that their effects were quite
important in slowing down work, although the actual damage done
was slight. As military diversions they were extremely effective
and they drew many planes away from the western front for de-
fensive work in which they were practically useless. Their po-
litical effect is doubtful. At first they certainly encouraged
enlistments and had a great propaganda value, but these effects
wore off in time and later in the war the continual attacks must
have had a considerable adverse moral effect. Repington describes
their demoralizing effect upon the British Cabinet.

National Strategy
When a navy has secured the control of the sea its control forces
may then exert economic pressure upon the enemy by preventing
his merchant vessels from passing through it. They may also
prevent neutral vessels from trading with the enemy either directly
or indirectly by:
a) Blockade of the enemy coast.
b) A system including inspection of cargoes, transference to
the contraband list of all articles and material, and pressure upon
neutrals to prevent enemy destination of goods.
Due to the changed conditions of naval warfare it was imprac-
ticable in the World War to declare a blockade of Germany which
would have any pretense of legality. The British, therefore, built
up a large force of armed merchant vessels to cover the area be-
tween Scotland and Norway to intercept all passing ships. As it
was dangerous because of submarines to inspect the ships at sea,
they were ordered by a new extension of international law to pro-
ceed into inspecting stations. The next step was to make every-
thing absolute contraband, despite the generally prevailing ideas
of international law. All that remained was to prove enemy des-
tination. This being impracticable in the case of goods consigned
to neutral countries, such goods were passed only if the consignee
guaranteed that they would not reach Germany; if this agreement
were broken the firms concerned would be blacklisted and no fur-
ther goods consigned to them would be passed. This system
finally resulted in an effective economic blockade of Germany, and
produced great and almost decisive results. Indirectly it struck
the German army heavy blows from the rear and had much to do
with its eventual breakdown. Its starvation feature, accompanied
by great increases of disease, particularly among the children, as
described by Philip Gibbs, struck a staggering blow at the morale
and will to conquer of the entire German nation. Its political
effects on neutrals were bad, but by skillful diplomacy and prop-
aganda, these were kept within limits, and the British were assisted
by the more apparent violation of international law by the German
submarine offensive.
In the Civil War the inability of the Confederate States to or-
ganize a battle fleet allowed a great part of the federal navy to
be used for legitimate blockade of the Southern States, which

U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
greatly influenced the result of the war. The British naval ex-
pedition up the Yangtze in 1842 so effectively cut the Chinese lines
of communications that they were forced by economic losses to
sue for peace.
Military forces may be used directly against the economic forces
of the enemy, but this is seldom their primary mission until the
enemy field armies have been destroyed. The German invasion
of France in 1914 was primarily to destroy the French Army, but
the incidental occupation of the coal and iron mines was a power-
ful blow at the French economic forces.
· After having gained a definite decision over the enemy field
armies the next objective for our military forces becomes the
economic forces of the enemy. Sherman's march from Atlanta and
Sheridan's devastation of the Shenandoah Valley were both direct
attacks on the enemy economic forces. The organization of a
nation is now so strong and complex and the economic forces of
the world are so interwoven that sometimes a military decision will
not in itself bring about the defeat of the enemy nation. In this
case it is necessary to use our military forces directly against the
economic forces of the enemy as the French did in the Ruhr. Such
operations, although apparently successful in this case, are very
costly and their political effects are doubtful. There is a distinct
limit to the penalties which may be imposed upon a defeated nation.
XVII. Defense of Our Economic Forces Against Hostile
Attack.—The second class of operations affecting the economic
forces is the resistance of the pressure of the enemy armed forces
upon our economic forces. As the enemy military forces will be
used for this purpose only after our field armies have been de-
stroyed, we may consider only naval attacks on our economic
forces.
A passive defense will require naval forces far superior to the
enemy attacking forces. Thus the allied forces resisting the Ger-
man submarine warfare were probably twenty times more numer-
ous than the entire German submarine service. The naval forces
used for resisting attack must be taken from the battle or scouting
fleets or produced at the expense of other naval, military or eco-
nomic forces. The allied anti-submarine organization, including
the shipbuilding industries developed, caused a great drain on all
the allied forces.

National Strategy
For these reasons it is naturally most desirable to organize
counter-blows against the enemy submarine, cruiser and air bases,
as these operations require only small forces compared with those
necessary for a passive defensive. In the World War, although
many plans were laid for the seizure of Borkum and the Belgian
bases, unfortunately very little materialized, except for the partly
successful blocking attacks on Zeebrugge and Ostend in 1918 and
some ineffective long range bombardments and bombing attacks.
Strong naval or combined attacks would appear to have been far
less costly than the terrible losses of the Flanders offensive which
had for one of its most important objects the seizure of the Bel-
gian bases.
Even with strongly organized counter-blows, it must be recog-
nized that some of our control forces must be used for defensive
purposes, notably escort duty. Such forces have a tendency to
grow to an abnormal and unnecessary size, as did our coastal
forces in the World War, which were useless and costly from both
naval and economic viewpoints. A special effort must be made to
keep such forces to an absolute minimum in the next war.
XVIII. Support of Our Economic Forces. Our third mission
in the group affecting the economic forces is that of assisting our
economic forces. This can be accomplished along two general
lines:
a) By using direct naval or military operations to obtain raw
material or to open up a route for the delivery of finished material.
b) By cooperation with the economic forces in their develop-
ment, maintenance, and operation.
The first line of action is a function of the detached and control
forces. On several occasions during the war military detached
forces were used for the purpose of obtaining raw material. One
example was the German expedition into the Ukraine to obtain
wheat. The necessity for obtaining food and oil was one of the
main reasons for the German offensive against Roumania, although
the primary reason was to destroy the Roumanian army and
shorten the front. This campaign also opened up the Danube as
a line of communications. One reason for the attack on the Dar-
danelles was to obtain food from Russia. The German Navy
assisted in the building of the U-Deutschland, which obtained val-
uable raw material in the United States.

Two of the main currents in the World War developed from
the necessity for opening up routes for the delivery of finished
material to allied nations temporarily cut off by enemy forces and
neutral nations from their source of supply. These were:
a) The efforts of Germany to supply Turkey which resulted in
von Mackensen's drive through Serbia and the establishment of
a direct line of communication from Berlin to Constantinople.
b) The attempts of France and Great Britain to supply Russia
through the Dardanelles, the White Sea, Vladivostok and the
Baltic.
A most interesting series of attempts was made by the Germans
to supply their forces in East Africa, including one long airship
flight.
The second line of action is a function of the administrative
bureaus and officers of the War and Navy Departments. We of
the Army and Navy depend to a great extent upon the backing
which the economic forces give us. They can only be properly
developed and maintained for war purposes if we assist them with
our cooperation. The following are some of the lines along which
we can help:
a) By assisting the development of our industrial system dur-
ing peacetime. In the past we have done very much to assist our
steel, engineering, electrical, shipbuilding and other activities,
which are essential to us in war. This assistance should be both
technical and financial. Churchill takes great pride in having kept
alive the Coventry Ordnance Works, which comprised one third of
England's capacity for making guns, by assigning them contracts
in 1913.
b) By determining in advance the requirements of the army
and navy and having tentative contracts arranged to be filled at the
declaration of war. Von Tirpitz had made arrangements before
the World War by which the usual peacetime contractors would
be required greatly to increase their contracts in the event of war
during the period of their effectiveness.
c) By cooperation in purchases between the army and navy
and other governmental departments.
d) By deciding in advance the merchant vessels to be allotted
to the army and navy. The navy preferably should operate all
such ships.

1371
National Strategy
e) By so regulating the draft procedure that there will be the
most suitable distribution of the nation's manpower among the
armed and economic forces.
f) By eliminating unnecessary demands upon the economic
forces.
g) By endeavoring to reduce the dislocation of our peacetime
industries insofar as possible, so our business prosperity will con-
tinue.
Finally, we must again remember the tremendous strain that war
makes upon our economic forces, and that it is not only our mis-
sion to win the war, but to win it as quickly as possible and with
the least drain on our economic forces. This is particularly the
case in a war of exhaustion which is prolonged to such an extent
that the victors are little better off than the vanquished. Rather
than prolong a war to such an extent, where only a Pyrrhic vic-
tory can be won, it is considered proper to force a decision even
if our chances of victory are thereby somewhat reduced. In other
words, we should never be satisfied to win a war as the World
War was won. An alliance with practically double the fighting
forces and economic resources of its enemy should not be content
to win by mere exhaustion after over four years of the costliest
national effort.
XIX. Operations Affecting the Political Forces. The de-
tached and control forces are available for a third general class of
operations, those affecting the political forces. Such operations
usually at the same time exert political pressure upon the enemy,
resist the pressure of the enemy armed forces on our political
forces, and assist our political forces in the execution of their war
mission. Incidentally, they involve contact with the enemy armed
and economic forces, but these are not their primary objectives.
In the first place, it must be distinctly recognized that the field
armies and battle fleet should not be used directly for political
purposes. Their mission is to win their respective campaigns and
by doing so they will indirectly create the greatest political in-
fluence. The Kaiser would not allow the high seas fleet to accom-
plish its only legitimate mission by engaging the grand fleet,
reserving it for use as a "political instrument.” It accomplished
nothing along these lines, but as a "naval instrument,” it might

1372
[Aug.
U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
then, and later did, have important effects on the course of the war.
The use of military and naval forces for political effect is usually
justifiable only when comparatively small forces are required to
accomplish this mission. It is extremely dangerous to detach large
forces from duty against the main forces of the enemy, where it
is known that they will have a definite military or naval effect, in
order to influence a very uncertain political situation, where they
may have no effect or even an unfavorable one. An example of
this was General Townshend's attack on Bagdad, which was made
mostly for political effect. Had he been successful great political
results would have been won, but when, despite his brilliant leader-
ship and the bravery of his troops, his entire detachment was cap-
tured at Kut, this produced exactly the opposite effect and the
British became involved in operations on a large scale in an un-
important theater of war. In general, forces may be used in the
following ways for political effect :
a) To induce a neutral nation to enter the war on our side or
to prevent one from joining the enemy.
b) To incite revolts or create disturbance in the enemy country.
c) To occupy enemy territory to improve our claims at the peace
conference.
d) To improve the political situation by winning some minor
but striking success of little actual military or naval importance.
XX. The W’inning of Neutral Support.- Naturally, the first
class of operations is by far the most important and here we will
often find great opportunities for winning important results with
small forces. In the World War we have the classic example of
the Goeben and Breslau ; these two ships contributed greatly to the
entry of Turkey into the war in accordance with her secret treaty
of August 2, 1914; they won a political victory which indirectly
liad as important results from military and naval viewpoints as
could have been gained by a succession of great battles. Turkey
and later Bulgaria held in play well over a million allied troops,
whose supply strained the transportation service and its protective
forces to the utmost limit.
One of the greatest problems of the British political forces was
to bring Italy into the war. That they should have been able to
accomplish this at the very time the Russians were being so badly


  p. 1373 (#291)                      #

19251
1373
National Strategy
beaten on the eastern front was a great feat; the British armed
forces used two measures to support their political forces :
a) The landing attack on the Gallipoli Peninsula to induce Italy
to enter the war in time for her share in the partition of Turkey.
b) The agreement to support the Italian Navy with four sec-
ond-line battleships and supplementary light forces, to increase its
chances of controlling the Adriatic.
The Gallipoli attack was also designed partly for its political
effect on Greece, Bulgaria and Roumania; had it succeeded the
Balkan states would have joined the Allies ; even its partial suc-
cess induced Greece to offer to join in the military operations, but
this advantage was vetoed by Russia in the strongest terms. When
the attack failed, Bulgaria could no longer be held back, and even
the offer of 200,000 troops to assist Roumania could not affect
her neutral attitude at this critical time. When later she was won
over, this proved to be to the advantage of Germany rather than
the Allies.
The agreement of Germany and Austria to support Bulgaria
with eleven divisions led by a famous general was instrumental in
inducing her to join the central powers.
Another political reason for the Dardanelles operation was to
further the British policy of giving encouragement to Russia by
winning Constantinople for her. But even in this respect the
political effect was opposite that intended, for when the British
failed when so near their goal the German propaganda service im-
planted the idea in Russia that the British had abandoned the
expedition to avoid having to turn Constantinople over to the
Russians according to the agreement.
XXI. The Incition of Revolts in Enemy Countries. It has
always been a principle of war to stir up portions of the enemy
population to revolt by furnishing the discontented elements with
troops and supplies. France, in her wars with Great Britain,
always endeavored to land troops in Scotland and Ireland. While
not formally at war with Great Britain during the first part of
the Revolutionary War, her assistance of the American Colonies
was meant as an indirect blow at Great Britain, and when that
country was deeply involved, France entered the war.


  p. 1374 (#292)                      #

1374
(Aug.
U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
In the World War it proved more difficult to incite revolts by
the use of military and naval forces; secret agents and propaganda
proved more successful. A German submarine and auxiliary were
used for landing the leaders and supplies for the Irish revolt of
Easter, 1916; the U-35 was instrumental in inducing the Senussi
tribesmen to revolt in Egypt by carrying a Turkish mission and
towing two boats loaded with military supplies for their use; small
British detachments induced the Arabian tribes to throw off their
Turkish allegiance and to operate with the British during the
Palestine campaign.
XXII. The Seizure of Enemy Territory. In most wars in
which an early decision is not reached, attempts are often made by
expeditionary forces, assisted by attached naval forces, to seize
enemy territory for the purpose of retaining such territory per-
manently or of trading it for other considerations at the peace con-
ference. It was in this way that Great Britain built up her empire
at the expense of Spain, Holland, France and Germany. In the
World War there was in addition the element of competition in
the seizure of outlying territory by the allied nations, as it was
realized possession would determine the allotment of the territory
at the peace conference. The seizure of German territory also
served the useful purpose of denying naval bases to the enemy
cruisers at large.
XXIII. Minor Operations for Political Effect.—Sometimes it
is justifiable to use small forces for the purpose of carrying out
an operation which will have a great political effect. Although the
U-Deutschland was sent to the United States for economic rea-
sons primarily, it was such a spectacular feat that it increased
German prestige in our country. The U-53 was doubtlessly sent
to Newport for political effect. Its remarkable cruise, however,
probably had an effect opposite to that intended. The cruise of
the U-51 to Constantinople and the subsequent sinking of two
British battleships had a great political effect. The sinking of the
Goliath by a Turkish destroyer manned by Germans indirectly
caused an open break in the British War Council as a result of
Fisher's ultimatum on the withdrawal of the Queen Elizabeth.
The sending of our first division to France was largely for po-
litical effect.


  p. 1375 (#293)                      #

1925)
1375
National Strategy
The sentimental value of taking Jerusalem, Bagdad and Da-
mascus probably was one of the minor reasons for undertaking
these operations.
We must remember that operations for political effect are only
justified when they can be undertaken by small forces; however,
there are usually opportunities for such action and in many cases
they will be very profitable.
XXIV. Cooperation Between the Army and Navy.—In a
prosecution of a war along the above lines, it is absolutely essential
that there be effective and constant cooperation between the army
and navy. During peacetime we possess such a means of coordina-
tion of effort in the Joint Board and Joint Planning Committee.
In wartime, by the addition of other officers, these organizations
can be readily transformed into a joint staff for directing the op-
erations of the military and naval forces along parallel lines, where
they can afford each other constant mutual support. This pooling
of the combined resources of our Army and Navy will give us an
inestimable advantage over an opponent who operates his army
and navy along entirely separate lines, as was so frequently the
case in the World War.
The Secretaries of War and Navy should be members of a de-
fense council for the purpose of coordinating the maintenance
and preparation of the armed, economic and political forces during
peacetime and their operation during war.
XXV. The Primary Mission and Composition of the Economic
Forces.--The primary mission of the economic forces is to sup-
port the armed forces. In order to do this they must be built up
during peacetime in such a way that they can be mobilized quickly
to meet war conditions. When war comes the greater part of the
economic forces should continue their normal peacetime activities
so as to carry on the national life. A lesser part must be converted
to such war use as may be necessary. In some cases entire indus-
tries must be devoted to war purposes and even greatly augmented,
but in no case should there be a greater dislocation of our economic
forces than is absolutely necessary, for this reduces our financial
stability. An extreme case appears in the wars for Dutch inde-
pendence when Dutch merchant vessels continually traded with
the enemy and even transported Spanish troops; the Dutch author-
ities sanctioned and even encouraged this unusual form of trad-

1376
(Aug.

ing with the enemy because they believed it the only means by
which they could earn sufficient money to carry on the war.
The economic forces are principally composed of the following:
a) Mining industries, particularly for coal, oil, iron and copper.
b) Manufacturing industries, particularly for munitions, equip-
ment, clothing, machinery, motor cars and airplanes.
c) Overseas transportation services.
d) Inland transportation services, including railways, inland
and coastwise shipping, motor and possibly even air transportation.
c) Shipbuilding industries, for both naval and merchant vessels.
f) Communication services, including radio, cables, telegraphs,
telephones, mail.
g) Financial system.
h) Agricultural system.
i) Commercial system, including its foreign connections.
j) Scientific organizations.
k) Medical profession.
XXVI. Uses of the Economic Forces in the W’orld War.-
There were many familiar examples in the World War of the way
in which these great national industries, systems and organizations
afforded indispensable assistance to the armed forces.
The Germans used to advantage the coal and iron mines of occu-
pied French territory; the oil fields of Roumania, although de-
stroyed by the British, were reopened in time by the Germans to
give them some much needed fuel. Before the war the British
had been able to design the Queen Elizabeth class to burn oil only
by reason of the Admiralty's investment of large sums of money
in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.
After the first part of the war had demonstrated the inability of
the War Office to furnish sufficient munitions, a special ministry
was formed for this purpose and by mobilizing all the manufactur-
ing plants in England and even many of those in the United States
it was able to supply ammunition and guns on such a scale that
the pressure upon the German armies was greatly increased. In
our country the development of standard designs for airplane
engines, motor trucks and machine guns allowed us to turn out
great quantities of such equipment and simplified both its pro-
cluction and operation. However, the decision on the standard

1925]
1377
National Strategy
design caused considerable delay, and in a future war we should
have the designs ready in advance. The Germans even went so far
as to form an auxiliary service and finally to draft illegally Bel-
gian workmen to assist in its operation.
The British mercantile marine was used for assisting all the
national forces in the World War. Under the supervision of the
navy it made possible the concentration of the field army in France,
it transported expeditionary forces over great distances to their
objectives and maintained their long lines of transportation during
extended campaigns. It assisted in the transport of our army to
France. It transported fuel and supplies for the British navy and
raw and finished material for the other economic forces.
The inland transportation services were also of the greatest
assistance to the armed forces. Not only did they provide supplies
for the field armies, but they contributed directly to many German
successes by the rapid transfer of troops from one front to another
or along lateral lines of communication behind the front in order
to effect a concentration for a break-through. So important were
strategic railways considered that before the war France loaned
large sums to Russia for the purpose of building up the lines of
communications in the Warsaw salient. These so greatly accel-
erated the Russian mobilization and strategic deployment on the
East Prussian frontier that France was repaid many times over
for her financial aid, even though the loans themselves are never
recovered from the Russian government.
The shipbuilding industry played an important part in the first
part of the war in completing the ships under construction and in
rushing through emergency building programs. The British had
detailed plans prepared for completing their ships under construc-
tion and as these ships joined the fleet its margin over the enemy
was so increased that the chances of the Germans winning a de-
cisive feet action were decreased to almost a negligible quantity.
As soon as these ships were completed, work was started on the
Fisher emergency program comprising ships especially designed
for the duties of the control forces. Later in the war the sub-
marine offensive was countered only by using all the facilities of
the British and American shipbuilding industries for building anti-
submarine craft and merchant vessels to replace those destroyed.

1378
[Aug.
U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
On the other hand, practically the entire German shipbuilding
industry was used for the production of submarines.
The various communication services were mostly taken over by
the armed forces and proved of the greatest utility for military
and naval operations and for economic purposes; they also were
of assistance to the political forces, particularly the propaganda
systems. Censorship of all forms of communications became a
recognized war duty and it furnished us with much valuable in-
formation in addition to preventing intelligence from reaching the
enemy.
The principal duty of the financial systems of the warring na-
tions was to obtain the funds for the great expenses incurred by
the armed forces and that portion of the economic forces devoted
to war purposes. One of the surprises of the war was the re-
markable strength of the financial forces, despite the predictions
that the cost of the war would bankrupt the nations in six months.
In no case could defeat be attributed to the failure of the financial
systems. It was only after the war that the finances collapsed,
and this was due partly to other causes.
Due to the British food blockade of Germany and the German
submarine blockade of England, agriculture assumed for a time
almost a decisive importance. The failure of the German potato
crop was as great a loss as a defeat on the fighting front. All
Germany was organized for producing food and Russian prisoners
were utilized to great advantage for work in the fields. All occu-
pied territory was cultivated, and frequently troops were used for
gathering crops. Leaves of absence were granted as far as possible
at the harvest time. In addition, rationing organizations were
formed for the distribution of food. Other countries were forced
to follow Germany's example.
The commercial system played an important part in the pur-
chase of supplies and equipment for the armed forces. Connec-
tions in neutral countries proved most important, particularly for
the British who used our country as a source of supplies almost
as effectively, except for price regulation, as though it were their
own territory. Their hold on our economic resources was so
strong that it was only with the utmost secrecy that nickel and
copper could be obtained for the cargoes of the U-Deutschland.
The British commercial organization throughout the world was a
marvel of efficiency, which is worthy of close study.

National Strategy
All countries found their scientific organizations of the great-
est utility in the invention and design of new instruments of war-
ſare. In addition, the German scientists showed ingenuity in
developing substitute materials to take the place of those cut off by
the blockade.
The possession of a large and efficient medical profession is of
incalculable advantage in wartime. In those countries which had
this advantage, the armies were able to keep their effectives very
high, due to the elimination of sickness and the return of the
wounded to the ranks, while the Balkan nations on the other hand
lost great numbers through sickness and had almost no provision
for caring for the wounded.
XXVII. Minor Missions of the Economic Forces. In addi-
tion to their main mission, the economic forces can perform other
minor functions in war:
a) Resistance to the armed forces, as in the case of the passive
resistance of the Belgians to the Germans and the organized resist-
ance of the German workmen and industrial leaders backed by the
government in the Ruhr. Such resistance has the grave defect
that it weakens our economic forces by the cessation of work.
b) Aggressive action against the enemy economic forces, as, for
example, the black-listing of neutral firms for trading with the
enemy, the refusal to furnish neutral ships with bunker coal un-
less they agree not to trade with the enemy, and an embargo on the
export of coal to neutral nations unless they furnish supplies in
return or agree not to furnish the enemy with supplies.
c) Assistance of our political forces, as, for example, the Anglo-
French loan negotiated in the United States, which welded a
powerful political tie between us and the leading allied nations ;
the war loans to neutral nations granted by the British, which
were practically subsidies for their participation in the war; our
war loans to the allied nations which renewed their political
strength at a critical period.
XXVIII. Organization of the Economic Forces. In order to
operate the economic forces there are needed: personnel, raw
material, money, and transportation. The allotment of these facil-
ities involves many difficult and conflicting considerations and must
be determined on a basis of priority by the defense council, one
member of which should be the "Economic Administrator,” who


  p. 1380 (#298)                      #

1380
(Aug.
U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
should have the wartime command of all the national economic
forces.
It is extremely important that the war organization of our eco-
nomic forces be worked out at least along its general lines during
peacetime, so that upon the declaration of war the necessary por-
tions of the economic forces can be mobilized into a great national
organization for carrying out their war mission, while the re-
mainder, so far as possible, carry on the national life of the
country as during peacetime. We will in this way avoid the
uncoordinated efforts of the World War, when our economic or-
ganization was built up little by little without any comprehensive
plan. If we did generally very effective work under this organiza-
tion, how much more could we have accomplished had real eco-
nomic war plans have been available at the declaration of war.
The economic administrator should supervise during war the
Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Agriculture, Labor, Interior
and Justice; the senior cabinet officer of this group should serve
as acting administrator during peacetime and should be responsible
for the preparation of the economic war plans.
Upon the declaration of war it will be necessary to appoint as
administrator one of the leading organizers and business men of
the country who has had wide experience along these lines. Pre-
ferably he should be familiar with military, naval and political
affairs. Roosevelt would have been an ideal man for this duty in
the World War.
XXIX. The Missions and Organization of the Political Forces.
The principal missions of the political forces are:
a) To attack directly the morale of the enemy nation.
b) To raise the morale of our own country.
c) To influence neutral nations to our advantage.
In former times the principal duty of our political forces was to
influence a small number of powerful individuals; our diplomatic
service was sufficient for that purpose.
Now that an entire population as well as the government must
be influenced, a propaganda service is formed to support our diplo-
matic service and to exert political influence over a wider field.
The propaganda service works both publicly and privately hand
in hand with the diplomatic service. It acts publicly through the


  p. 1381 (#299)                      #

1925)
1381
National Strategy
medium of news agencies, newspapers, publishing companies
magazines and books; privately, it acts through our educational
and religious systems and social, political, labor and fraternal or-
ganizations.
In the same way that our armed and economic forces must be
built up and prepared during peacetime so must our political forces
be used in peacetime in preparing the ground for their war meas-
ures. The political campaigns should be as carefully planned and
prepared as those of the economic and armed forces.
XXX. Attacks on the Enemy Morale.--In attacking the mo-
rale of the enemy nation we have two general methods :
a) To work secretly against selected individuals or organiza-
tions.
b) To attack publicly the enemy nation as a whole.
In any nation there are weak spots. These may consist of either
influential individuals or groups of people, whose actions weaken
the government through mistaken idealism or deliberate defection
stirred up by past grievances. The encouragement of these in-
dividuals or groups in their opposition to the enemy government is
a delicate question. Often no action is necessary or even desirable,
for their action is hostile to the enemy government rather than
friendly to ours.
Formerly it was easier to cause the defection of influential men
than in the present era. Philip of Macedon used to say that no city
could hold out against him into which he could drive an ass laden
with gold. In the age of mercenary troops treachery was of quite
common occurrence; it was also prevalent in revolutions, there
being familiar examples in the American and French revolutions ;
it also occurs in times of great national disaster, where a great
nation falls before its enemies; notable examples are Talleyrand
in 1814 and certain Germans in 1918; these traitors had little
difficulty in winning over other persons whose resolution had been
broken by military defeats; one may read in the memoirs of the
Crown Prince of the complete moral breakdown of the German
Great Headquarters at Spa in November, 1918, similar in every
detail to that of Napoleon's at Fontainebleau.
But, except at the actual breakdown of nations, when the sauve
qui peut begins, there were very few people of any importance


  p. 1382 (#300)                      #

1382
[Aug.
U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
whose actions weakened the morale of their own countries; Ger-
many had its Lichnowsky and Liebknecht; France its Caillaux,
Merrheim, Faure and Hubert; only Austria and Bulgaria afforded
numerous examples of defection.
Our secret propaganda can also be directed with effect against
some selected minorities in enemy countries. This usually is a
racial minority. Thus the Germans selected the Poles and the
Irish as the objectives of their intrigues; the French, the Alsa-
tians; the Russians, the Czechs; the Serbians, the people of Bosnia
and the Banat; the Italians, the Austrian citizens of Italian de-
scent; the British, the Arabs. The Bolsheviks worked through
the German Communist party and undermined the very founda-
tions of the German Empire. The French pacifists about ruined
France in 1917. In some way, possibly through our representative
at Sofia, the Bulgarian army was won over, so that the five divi-
sions on the front attacked by the Allies marched home without
making any resistance.
It was expected that the religious, political, labor and fraternal
organizations of international scope would be an important means
for influencing enemy nations, but the national spirit was so strong
that it broke all such ties. Even the relationship of monarchs,
despite reports at the time, had surprisingly little effect.
To work publicly against the enemy nation as a whole we have
two general methods of operation :
a) Official statements of our political and military leaders.
b) Organized propaganda in newspapers and magazines.
The first method was usually employed to detach the people from
their governments. It was used by the Germans in their various
peace offensives to show that the Central Powers wished peace
and that the allied governments were responsible for the prolonga-
tion of the war. It was used even more effectively by President
Wilson who induced the Germans to depose their own leaders and
bring about the downfall of their Empire by creating the impres-
sion that once a republic was formed the German people would
be treated with great consideration; meanwhile the Fourteen
Points found their way into the scrap-basket, as they could not
well remain on the table along with the Treaty of Versailles.
While official reports of military and naval operations are mostly
for the purpose of raising the morale of our own people, they

should, if practicable, also be utilized for breaking the confidence
of the enemy nation, care being taken that they remain strictly
truthful, so as not to induce overconfidence in our own people.
The German reports were so effectively drawn that, according to
Repington, their publication was prohibited in Great Britain.
The second method, that of using propaganda controlled by the
government, is used principally for breaking the confidence of the
enemy in victory. As this is meant for publication in enemy and
neutral countries and has not the official stamp of approval it is
not so necessary to keep strictly to the truth. This method includes:
a) Exaggeration of the effect of battles. A Somme, a Flanders,
or even a Jutland can be manufactured into a victory. A remark-
able opportunity was afforded to make Pyrrhic tactical victories in
Mesopotamia and the Palestine into great strategic successes.
Much was made of the retreat of the Germans to the Hindenburg
line, although this really strengthened the German position and
had much to do with the total breakdown of the allied offensives
of 1917.
b) The exaggeration of enemy losses, in order to create the im-
pression that the enemy leaders are ruthlessly sacrificing their
troops. The allied propaganda along these lines was most effective,
although now we see that the charge could be made against their
own commanders rather than the German generals.
c) The exaggeration of our reinforcements and new equipment
being prepared. This was a constant feature of our wartime
propaganda. Despite the fact that few of these predictions—as,
for instance, those about aircraft and eagle boats—ever material-
ized, they doubtless had their effect on the enemy; it seems to be
a human failing to think continually of what the enemy can do to
you rather than what you can do to the enemy.
XXXI. Measures to Raise the Morale of Our People. The
second mission of our political forces is to raise the morale of our
own people. This can be accomplished:
a) By working privately through various civil organizations.
b) By public official statements and organized propaganda.
c) By taking appropriate action against unpatriotic individuals
and organizations.
In our country splendid work was done during the last war to
raise the morale of our people by all our civil organizations. Our

educational system always provides a means for building up a
spirit of patriotism during peacetime and in these days of pacifism
particular attention should be given to training our youth in love
of our country. Our religious systems also form a potent means
of raising the morale of our people and during the war their work
was very effective along these lines; it is to be hoped that our re-
ligious organizations will continue to exert all their efforts in en-
couraging patriotism and love of country. During the World War
all of our social, political, labor and fraternal organizations used
their powerful influences correctly, but some minor political and
labor organizations are now centers of defection.
In wartime great countries usually have one or more great
leaders whose public statements in time of defeat or even despair
can rally their nations once more behind them. Thus time and
time again the Germans rallied behind the towering figure of Hin-
denburg and perhaps could even have been rallied at the very end
had not the exhaustion of four years' struggle finally worn down
the moral strength of their leader himself. Even in the darkest
hours of 1918 the fighting spirit of Clemenceau, who so typified his
people, kept the French to their task. President Wilson, during
wartime, had a remarkable influence over his people, and his de-
cision to draft a large army for use in France-a decision which
decided the war—was accepted without the slightest opposition by
the nation at large. In the first months of the war Lord Roberts,
Kitchener and Fisher raised the fighting spirit of the British to the
highest degree and the people accepted without question all their
decisions for throwing all the nation's strength into the struggle.
All publicity connected with the war should be controlled by the
propaganda service and handled in accordance with correct prin-
ciples. It must be realized that untruthfulness is a dangerous ex-
pedient and that such propaganda may be a two-edged sword,
which may injure us more than the enemy. Thoughtless action
on our part may needlessly embitter the enemy or create over-
confidence in our country. It is strongly believed that the course
of the war should be truthfully described to our people. When we
start concealing defeats and publishing fictitious victories we take
a dangerous course. In the first place, this tends to make our
people overconfident and to believe that all is going well, whereas
in fact a dangerous situation may exist. In the second place, un-

National Strategy
truthful statements are usually detected in the end and this under-
mines the people's confidence in the government and will lead them
to suspect future official statements; furthermore, if the situation
should continue to grow worse, there will come a time when this
will have to be disclosed and then the issuing of bad news which
has been accumulating for a long period will be a great shock to
the people and a heavy blow at their morale; thus the British
people were entirely unprepared for the news of the German
break-through of March 21, 1918. Where a great crisis or battle
is imminent, it is entirely correct to conceal the news of some minor
defeats, which may be wiped out by the coming engagement,
A measure frequently employed during war is to accuse the
enemy of committing inhuman atrocities; this is almost always a
resort of a defeated army; it is seldom used by a victorious one.
This, it is true, is extremely effective in instilling our people with
hatred for the enemy, but it is the lowest form of warfare; if
submarine warfare and poison gas are to be prohibited, how much
more should be this treacherous and underhanded attack, which
poisons the minds of entire populations and causes unspeakable
bitterness for years to come. If such propaganda embitters our
nation against the enemy it likewise causes equal hatred in the
enemy nation for us. Regardless of the truth of the charges made
the nation with the most effective propaganda will win this in-
famous campaign. Furthermore, it should be remembered that
these attacks are made on our own profession and that they may
react against us in future years.
During the World War such effective action was taken in our
country against disloyal or unpatriotic citizens or residents that
they were unable to accomplish anything of importance; we were
far superior to all the European nations in this respect.
XXXII. Measures to Influence Neutral Nations. The great-
est field for the use of our political forces is that of the neutral
nations. From the start of the war both British and Germans
started political campaigns with this end in view. The diplomatic
service was in the main employed in this campaign, but it was sup-
ported most effectively by the propaganda service and assisted by
the armed and economic forces. In general, the European nations
were swayed by two ideas:
a) Which side would make the best offer.


  p. 1386 (#304)                      #

1386

b) What were the chances of actually getting the territory or
other considerations offered.
To take an example, the Allies could freely offer Italy large
slices of Austrian and Turkish territory. They could back up
their diplomatic offers to the government by converting the people
at the same time by their propaganda. They could offer Italy
assistance by their armed and economic forces. The Allies also
appeared to have the best chances of victory. On the other hand,
Germany could not induce Austria to cede much territory to its
hereditary enemy; their propaganda was less effective and they
could furnish little assistance with their armed and economic
forces; as a consequence the Germans were fortunate to keep Italy
neutral until their Russian campaign was well under way. They
were also able to keep Italy from formally declaring war on Ger-
many and continued to get many essential materials.
In Bulgaria, on the other hand, the Germans held the trump
cards. They could freely offer Serbian territory, which, hy
Churchill's admission, was rightly Bulgarian. They even induced
their ally—Turkey—to cede immediately a small but important
slice of land. They could offer strong military and economic as-
sistance and could point to their Russian successes and the British
failure at the Dardanelles as proof of their certainty of winning.
As they knew Bulgaria would never enter a war against the United
States, the Germans, especially, stopped the submarine campaign
for this reason. Their one failure was the maintenace of the
United States diplomatic service at Sofia after we entered the war;
this gave us an unrivalled opportunity for propaganda.
The United States was in a different category from the Euro-
pean nations. We wanted nothing for ourselves and would enter
the war either :
a) To assist the side which had our strong moral sympathy in
case it should appear to be in serious danger of losing the war.
b) To resist the illegal action of one of the warring nations.
In the first case it was entirely a question of our sympathy. In
the second it was partly a question of the gravity of the offense and
partly one of sympathy. We would undoubtedly have permitted
Great Britain and France to commit greater breaches of inter-
national law than would have been permitted to Germany. Thus

1925]
1387
National Strategy
the one really important matter was to win our sympathies. The
Allies were certain to win the propaganda game in the United
States, because:
a) The British have always been head and shoulders above the
rest of the nations in diplomacy and propaganda. Their whole
history is based on their ability to win over neutral nations to their
side and to form coalitions against the leading continental power.
Their diplomacy and propaganda were the chief weapons which a
century ago brought down Napoleon. On the other hand, with
the exception of Bismarck, the German diplomacy has always been
clumsy, and their propaganda, while perhaps suited for Russians
and the Balkan people, caused such adverse results in the United
States that it had to be stopped entirely. Von Bernstorff alone
seems to have had some understanding of our character and he
undoubtedly did exceptionally good work until his government,
by the decision to commence again the submarine offensive, took
the matter out of his hands.
b) The British had the advantage that many of our most in-
Auential people made a habit of residing for long periods in France
and England and as a consequence strongly favored those coun-
tries. In addition, the British held all the trump cards for their
propaganda. The power who acts on the offensive, while having
all the military advantages, unfortunately has many political dis-
advantages. As he is the invader, it is easy to prove that he is
also the aggressor. It is easy to allege atrocities by the invader
which it is impossible for him to disprove. In addition, the Ger-
mans, while not generally a military race, were of recent years
considerably dominated by military leaders, and our dislike of
everything military, even reasonable readiness for war, placed the
Germans under a grave disadvantage. Finally, the British were
able to take advantage of several incidents of no real importance,
but which when presented with their usual skill for effect, had a
remarkable propaganda value.
c) The British had the great advantage of a common language
which facilitated their propaganda, while all German propaganda
had to be translated and republished.
d) The British had the advantage of cable and radio communi-
cations, as well as the mail, while the Germans had to rely on a
few radio stations.

It must be realized that it is not necessarily an advantage to
bring a nation into the war on our side. It was probably an ad-
vantage for Germany-disguised at first it is true—when Rou-
mania entered the war on the opposite side. On the other hand
the Germans believed that we were serving the allied cause as much
while we remained neutral as we could if we entered the war. This
certainly was a mistake which cost them dearly. Had they delayed
the announcement of the submarine campaign until the beginning
of the Russian revolution, they would have seen that it was un-
necessary to win the war; in that case we would not have entered
the war at all, or if so we would probably have delayed until it
was too late to prevent a German victory.
XXXIII. Organisation of the Political Forces.- For the po-
litical forces to exert their greatest influence it is necessary that
all the various forms of our diplomacy and propaganda be care-
fully coordinated; usually propaganda which is suited for under-
mining the confidence of the enemy or winning the sympathy of
a neutral nation is of far too exaggerated a nature to use for our
own population, which must be told honestly the true state of
affairs. In the same way we will not wish the actual conditions
to be known to neutral nations or to the enemy country. As an
example, British leadership had to shoulder the blame for the ter-
rible losses of the Flanders offensive of 1917; this was made
largely to draw the attention of the Germans away from the
French army, whose morale was so far broken that British writers
now admit that the situation throughout 1917 after the Aisne
offensive was the most critical of the whole war, not even except-
ing 1918. At that time, however, the true facts about the French
army could not be revealed to anyone, because it would soon have
become known to the Germans, probably with disastrous effect ;
the skill with which such a large secret was kept was most remark-
able, but as a result British leaders were strongly criticized for
the heavy losses of their troops.
In the World War the State Department, the Army, the Navy
and various other agencies were engaged in propaganda work; as
a result there was little coordination. Our political forces, includ-
ing all forms of propaganda, should be operated in accordance
with a definite system and a carefully thought out plan of cam-
paign. It would appear that the State Department is the agency

National Strategy
in our government best suited for operating the political forces
and that it should, after consultation with the other interested
departments, draw up the policies to guide our work and the
definite diplomatic and propaganda plans to attack the enemy mo-
rale, to raise the war spirit of our own people and to win the sym-
pathies of the important neutral nations. This should not prevent
the various agencies for spreading propaganda from engaging in
local work suited to their immediate needs, in the way that the
Germans undermined the morale of the Italian armies in the fall
of 1917, but whenever propaganda is of more than local importance
it should be coordinated with the general plan of the State De-
partment.
XXXIV. The Defense Council.-In order effectively to direct
the armed, economic and political forces in proper coordination so
as to create the greatest national effort, a defense council should
be charged with the conduct of the war under the direction of the
President, who is the commander-in-chief of all our forces. The
Secretaries of State, War and Navy and the economic administra-
tor should be the only members of the council. The disadvantages
of a larger council are most feelingly shown by Churchill in his
description of the conduct of the war by the British War Council
in the latter part of 1915.
In important conferences the council will be presided over by
the President. When desirable, members should bring their assist-
ants to conferences; this should apply particularly to the chief of
the General Staff and the chief of Naval Operations. Where
special situations are to be discussed the officers who have made
the closest study of them and are most familiar with their possi-
bilities should be allowed to express their opinions and present
their recommendations.
There should be in addition a defense council staff composed of
persons nominated by the members of the council. This staff
should draw the general plans and issue the orders for combined
operations based on the decisions of the council ; the staff should
be authorized to initiate proposals for combined operations and
make recommendations for the better coordination of the national
forces.
XXXV. Conclusion. In this paper the outline of the problem
of national strategy has alone been sketched. Each one of the

various phases herein briefly indicated is worthy of a study in
itself. The proposals for a defense council and staff have indi-
cated merely the general ideas for the formation of these important
agencies, preferably by an expansion of the present Joint Board,
which has done so much to bring the Army and Navy together.
The details of its operation would have to be worked out in actual
practice. These agencies are just as important now in peace time
as in war; their formation agrees with the present demand of our
people for economy, because there is no doubt but that the opera-
tion of such agencies would greatly increase our national readiness
for war without added expense. A real coordination of our na-
tional forces in the next war will be worth many army corps and
battleships.
While one object of this paper has been to stress the increased
importance of the economic and political forces, it must still be re-
membered that the armed forces strongly predominate in war.
Furthermore, it is forces which attack which count; we want
armed forces which will be more than a First Line of Defense,
unless by this phrase we mean to insure defense by attack. We
must think of war as comprising attacks on the enemy, attacks in
his own waters, attacks to gain the control of waters which are
vital to him ; only by such operations can we decide the war in our
favor without bringing an excessive strain on our economic forces,
and justify the sums of money which are expended annually for
the maintenance of the armed forces.
