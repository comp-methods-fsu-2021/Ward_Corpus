I have already contacted the USS Intrepid Museum in New York and have recently
contacted the Newport News Shipyard for access to their records.


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
