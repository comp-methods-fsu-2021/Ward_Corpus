a) These figures include 1,044 officers and 8,439 men of the British Royal Air Force that are performing
duties similar to those performed by the personnel of the U. S. Naval Aviation. The Royal Air Force
is a separate Department ranking with the Army and Navy and has in round numbers 3,365 officers
and 28,880 airmen and 7,815 civilians. Sincc in the United States, Japan and France, naval aviation
personnel forms an integral part of the Navy, it seems only fair that the personnel of the British Royal
Air Force performing duties in connection with naval aviation should be classed in this comparison,
b) Includes 4,113 civilians manning auxiliaries and yard craft for which regularly enlisted personnel
are required in cases of other powers.
c) There is no organized naval reserve of men in Italy, but men who have served in Navy may be
called to colors by levy.
d) Does not include 7,459 retired officers of all ages nor 18,405 pensioners under fifty-five years of
age, who form an additional reserve.
e) Does not include 1,348 retired officers of all ages, nor 261 retired enlisted men, under fifty-five
years of age, who form an additional reserve.
f) An increase in round numbers of about 1,000 enlisted men over May 1924.

1922-23, thereby reducing the actual number of ships retained by Italy as per treaty from ten to seven.

Table X-NAVAL AIR STRENGTH (Unlimited)
Note: The tables compiled herewith indicate the airplanes which may be carried with the different
combatant ships of the fleets away from a coast defense area of 1,000 miles. No fairer com-
parison of naval air strength can be made than that based on the plane-carrying capacity of
the fleets at sea. In this connection, it is assumed that aircraft carriers will carry a balanced
force of airplanes-such as bombing, combat, observation planes. In case aircraft carriers
should carry only the smaller types of planes (combat planes) the carrying capacities would be
naturally increased.
