SOME NOTES ON DESTROYER HANDLING
ALONGSIDE
By LIEUTENANT H. R. THURBER, U. S. Navy
W E WERE waiting in the cool of the morning for the
V U.S.S. V— to pull away from us at the anchorage to the
west of Culebra. A choppy sea bumped the V— 's star-
board side against us, and a fresh trade wind strained our anchor
chain broad on the port bow. Captain — with bronzed outlay
of two and a half stripes folded over his lee bridge rail, stuck out
his jaw—and pipe-in response to our “Good morning, sir !" He
glanced astern where, a scant 300 yards, lay two pairs of destroy-
ers at anchor. “Let go all lines !” he snapped out. “Both engines !
Back two thirds! Right ten degrees rudder !” And, as an after-
thought, with grandstand flourish, and oblivious to the roaring of
blowers, belching of stacks, and celerity in handling lines, he waved
us a farewell with his pipe, the V- already shooting astern like
an arrow. Almost at our stern the V—_'s bow quivered as she
was dragged to a stop; slowly it drifted past our stern from port
to starboard, and with a dash she scampered past us to starboard
and headed out for her screen position in the day's tactical prob-
lem. “Great seamanship” remarked our skipper, and all on the
bridge agreed. Captain J- was known throughout the squadron
as a dashing ship handler.
That evening we anchored and waited for the 1- to come
alongside. She came sliding up on our port quarter—we all watch-
ing from our bridge with interest. Up alongside she glided, per-
fectly. Then something went wrong. The V did not stop
according to Hoyle, but with a grinding away of sidelights, bridge
windshields, forecastle stanchions and lifelines, she swooped ahead
half a length. Pandemonium broke loose on the V— 's bridge,
men scrambled to the rails, the water astern frothed as her engines
backed frantically. It was a matter of seconds ere the
V l ay
panting alongside, but the net result on Captain J— 's demeanor
was so terrible-eyes flashing wildly, veins starting, pipe and arms

waving, and traditionally seamanlike phrases flooding the air-
that we hastened below decks to our stateroom, there to light our
pipe and feverishly compile the following notes on handling de-
stroyers alongside.
These have been edited, expurgated, freed of their fever, and
are presented now with apologies to Admirals Knight, Luce and to
the several destroyer captains whose seamanship has been ob-
served. No exhaustive treatise on destroyer seamanship, this;
just a few "wrinkles” noticed and herewith presented, following
the precepts of very cautious destroyer captains who never have
carried away docks, breakwaters, anchors, or propellers—at least,
not more than once. Lucky men!
General Considerations.--At the risk of boring the reader to
tears, the following general points are laid out. The destroyer
handler should know the length, beam and draft of his ship, and
have a bird's-eye picture in his mind of these dimensions—it won't
do to try to wedge into a twenty-foot crack, secure to a dock with
only seventy-five yards of extreme draft water alongside at low
tide, or make twenty-five knots over a twenty-four foot channel.
In connection with the draft, it should be ascertained how much
the propeller's tips extend below the keel—in certain types of de-
stroyers this projection amounts to as much as one foot, ten and a
half inches below the keel, from which a carpenter's mate will
usually log the draft. During the course of most any well-regu-
lated cruise, the Roman numerals noting propeller draft will be
painted over—besides, to some draft recorders, the darn things
don't mean anything. One captain in my short recollection forgot
his propeller draft and destroyed his steaming multiple for the
month trying to shake loose from a spot in the Potomac River.
The height of the masthead might make some difference in going
under bridges or aerial cables. The width of the foremast yardarm
should be considered in going alongside; some captains prefer
"staggering” their ship, so the yardarm will not mesh with others
alongside in case of a list, due to oiling or a rocking swell. It is
but careful seamanship to note the relative position of propeller
guards, as “locked” or “riding” guards will do some damage, even
to the extent of involving the propellers themselves. The guard
rails should be separated by a fender of sufficient dimension to pre-
vent riding up and down of the rails. A careful seaman will sweep

his eye from forecastle to fantail on the "engaged” side to ensure
a clear side—scupper lip extensions housed; sidelights removed ;
boats, davits, torpedo tubes, gangways, windscoops and anchor
flatly rigged. Some urge the “decking' of the inboard anchor as
necessary, even in most favorable conditions, regarding this latter
as an "evolution," which word has found much expansion in the
destroyer force, sounding less ‘irksome, perhaps, than "drill.”
These points seem self-evident, but in time of stress they are apt
to be overlooked; hence, the inclusion.
Definite understanding with the engine room in the matter of
standard speed when getting underway from alongside or when
going alongside, should be made as a special point. The engineer
officer, who, according to the blue book, must be in the master
engine room control station, should be informed of the antics an-
ticipated; emergency gongs should be tested out just before getting
underway and at an appropriate time before going alongside; and
the "getting underway" details should be at their stations. In ex-
tending the remarks on standard speed, please allow the following
excerpt from one destroyer's "Ship Standing Orders” as an illus-
tration of definite understanding :
Standard speed is that speed in knots designated by the commanding
officer. Unless word is received to the contrary, this shall be fifteen knots
when getting underway. Ahead standard is the command for standard
speed ahead.
Ahead one third is one third of standard speed.
Ahead two thirds is two thirds of standard speed.
Back one third is that speed astern resulting from the maintenance of
fifty pounds pressure on the astern turbine steam gage.
Back two thirds is that speed astern resulting from the maintenance of
100 pounds pressure on the astern turbine steam gage.
Back full speed is that speed astern resulting from the introduction of
steam full into the astern turbine, provided that main steam gage pressure
is not carried below 200 pounds.
The following resultants of different combinations of opposite engine
speeds obtain on this ship:
Ahead one third on one engine, back one third on another; resultant
direction of ship, astern.
Ahead two thirds on one engine, back one third on other; resultant direc-
tion of ship, ordinarily pivot, or very slow ahead.
Ahead standard or ahead full speed on one engine, back one third on
other; resultant direction of ship, ahead:

Destroyer Handling Alongside
Ahead standard on one engine, back two thirds on other; resultant direc-
tion of ship, pivot, or very slow astern.
Other combinations may be deduced and combined with rudder throw.
Generally, this ship will back into the wind, unless at or nearly at full load
fuel condition. Generally, this ship, light, cannot be headed up from a beam
wind into the wind, and for this reason especially in crowded harbors, an
anchor must be ready for letting go to accomplish this end by the simple
expedient of allowing the ship to swing on her anchor up into the wind.
Before relinquishing the topic of standard maneuvering speed,
it may be well to insert one other precaution. When you ring up
"stop," do your throttlemen merely close the throttle valve? Or
do they introduce steam into the opposite motion turbine and bring
and hold the shafts to a dead stop? Without arguing the varying
points in favor of each—let alone the violation of “best engineer-
ing practice”—the writer believes in the first method because: (a)
the ship is not dragged into unexpected quarters by “checking"
(with possible reversing) of the shafts; (b) the engineering mul-
tiple is not ruined by the use of power necessary to hold the shafts;
(c) the writer has seen both methods used, and has observed the
first is as adaptable as the second. It is well, though, in the case
of an initial attempt with a new command, to ascertain which
method is "standard practice.”
Personnel and Material.—Some note should be made here, be-
fore going to actual typical conditions, of the personnel and ma-
terial involved. Under practically all conditions the following
deck stations should be manned as shown below, and checked by
the executive officer before he reports, “All ready for getting
underway, sir!" Personnel on the bridge: chief quartermaster
(or best helmsman) at the wheel ; chief yeoman at engine room
annunciators; one quartermaster at whistle; one quartermaster at
upper bridge searchlight (if at night); speed cone men at cones;
signalmen at flag bags; talker at voice tubes to after deck house
and to main searchlights (if at night); messenger at hand. The
annunciator man should understand thoroughly the use of the
emergency gongs, also, if at night, the use of the truck (speed)
light. The "engaged side" rail of the bridge must be kept clear.
All orders should be repeated back. The executive should man a
small megaphone and stand near the wheel, and emergency gongs.
The navigator should be at hand, of course. Free gangway must
be afforded the ship handler, and to that effect all sight seers

should be assigned to the nether regions, if necessary, by the use of
good, round vocal authority.
On the forecastle, aside from the crew at quarters, the first
lieutenant usually oversees the deck force. Preliminary notice of
the engaged side should be given him if the ship is to go alongside,
so his lines may be ready for running, and the engaged anchor
brought in on deck. One small fender should be ready for use at
the billboard and one at the break of the forecastle. Heaving lines
minus lead weights are in favor with those on the receiving end.
For celerity in handling, the bow line should be known as “Num-
ber One," the after spring as “Number Two," and the forward
spring as “Number Three”; and the first lieutenant should have
his men instructed as to the relative difference of "checking,"
“slacking" and "holding" these lines. The capstan should be ready
for immediate use, remembering that much steam can be saved the
main engines by the use of this important auxiliary, with no at-
tendant shame to the ship handler for "wishy-washy" seamanship.
A breast line, known as “Number Four," run through the free-
ing ports or chocks on the well deck after the other lines are se-
cured, is firmly advocated by many captains as a stabilizer in a
tideway, during fuelling and for turning in pairs.
The large cane fender provided destroyers should be slung over
the side of the galley deck house well before going alongside, to
serve as a guard rail buffer.
Some destroyer captains believe in stationing an officer with
megaphone on the engaged side of the galley deckhouse to facili-
tate “emergency” communications aft.
Going aft, the main searchlights should be mentioned. At night,
these may be indispensable, should be tested, and should be en-
sured effective coʻnmunication. Searchlights have unexpected uses
and should be ready for immediate use without having to send for
the chief electrician's mate who may be making his toilet prepara-
tory to walking over the gangplank.
The after deckhouse is the domain of the gunnery officer, and a
good voice tube talker with his ear to the bridge tube. The ord-
nance force on the fantail are required to "cinch in" the stern, and
must realize that, under most conditions, this cinching in is a very
important part of securing with snap. A few "heave in the stern"
conditions will bring a keen appreciation of this point. A fender

ready to secure over the propeller guard (permanent guard fenders
are unsightly on a trim destroyer) will often save the paint work,
let alone a dent in the guard, as well as the other fellow's plating.
Of course, if one is so fortunate as to have a kite balloon winch
aft, the stern may be safely hung off and heaved in later. One
more point in regard to the gunnery officer, good seamanship will
teach him to clear bumboats astern, have the clothes lines clear of
clothes, have the garbage chute rigged in, and similar eyesores to
the squadron commander eclipsed.
Of course, "colors” must be shifted with a snap. It often dis-
concerts other ship captains in the vicinity to see some ship free
of the "jack” forward and flying an ensign aft both at the staff
and at the gaff!

Now to the muttons ! Certain typical conditions will be shown,
with brief outlines of "what do,” but it is hoped that destroyer
handlers will appreciate the "tenderness” of a destroyer and its
"whims," so that in case the solutions do not meet with seemly
success, no blame will be attached to the writer, 'for the solutions
presented have been worked out before his eyes. “A destroyer
frequently does just the opposite of what one thinks it should do,"
is the experience of one captain. Another says, “Don't rely too
much on theory!" And still another states that “an analysis of
what happened after the battle will tend to straighten you out for
future conditions of a similar nature.” Which leads to repeat an
adage particularly applicable to destroyers, “You never find two
alike at any one time, and you never find one alike twice.” Hence,
they call a ship "she.”

pier. Note carefully the tide, wind and surrounding shipping.
Given, the ideal case of the two ships riding direct to wind and
tide, with no interference ahead or astern. Going ahead is
simple if handled with despatch. The illustration, marked Fig. 2,
is self-explanatory—own ship shaded. As the case is presented,
give, “right fifteen degrees rudder!" Instruct first lieutenant to
hold “Number Three." Let go all other forecastle lines. The tide

and wind will force the bow out, and Number Three will further
spring the bow away. As the bow starts to work out, let go all
lines and give “Port engine! Ahead one third !" The rudder and
ahead motion will work the stern
* OBSTRUCTION away sufficiently to use both engines.
As stern clears, give, “Rudder
amidships ! Both engines, ahead
two thirds!" Should the stern tend
to swing back toward the anchored
ship (or the anchored ship swing
in), resort to the action shown in
the third phase of the figure.
If there is interference ahead,
the case is resolved as shown in
Fig. 3.

Here, the wash of the starboard

screw running into the confined
space between the two ships will at
first force their sterns apart. As own ship gathers sternboard, the
rudder will counteract this and draw own stern across the stern
of the anchored vessel.

With wind conditions adverse, the case becomes more compli-
cated. Take a case as follows: wind strong on own exposed beam,
other ship anchored with anchor broad on her bow and across
yours, tide holding ships as shown in diagram, Fig. 4.

The problem above is to prevent raking. By "cinching in” the
bow, first housing such obstructions as anchors on both ships, the
stern is cleared for reversing both engines. When all ready to
cast off, the anchored ship might heave in on her anchor, as this
will tend to head both ships up into the wind and tend to keep her
stern clear when lines are cast loose. The two thirds (or full)
astern will clear the ships rapidly enough to prevent the anchored
ship from swinging back. The inboard engine will further separate
the ships by the "wash.” It would be slightly better to reverse the
outboard engine a fraction before the inboard engine to give the
stern an initial set "in," with a consequent set "out" for the bow.
In closing this case, it might be added that an attempt to go out
ahead would be well nigh impossible without "ruining everything."
Another case would be with wind strong on other ship's exposed
beam, with her anchor out to windward as shown below, tide hold-

Going Alongside Anchored Ships. Having touched upon solu-
tions of getting away from an anchored ship without scratching
her paintwork, take now some typical examples of going alongside
a ship at anchor. A caution in all cases : do not get your bow or
your stern so close you can't get 'em away! Ready lines, fenders,
efficient communication with after deckhouse (and searchlights),
clear side, special bridge details, and engine rooms! Also, a cau-
tionary signal in ample time to the ship approached! The gen-
erally ideal approach, when possible, is from the anchored ship's
quarter, so that own ship is in relative position as shown in Fig. 7.

At this point, the ship should be moving slowly ahead. Too
much speed may easily result in dented sides, bent noses, ripped
stanchions, and general ruin, considering the sensitiveness of de-
stroyers when not under deft control, or should there be a casualty
in engine room control. Naturally, wind and tide conditions should
be observed and their effect not only on own ship's action but also
on the anchored ship's, noted.
First, take an ideal condition, with anchored ship riding to wind
and tide. The simplest maneuver to make the side is shown in
Fig. 8. .
STOP
10 LEFT
Fig. 8
This maneuver brings in the stern without involving the inboard
engine at close quarters. If the bow is not "in," the capstan will
remedy that condition. The writer has seen a ship drift alongside
without backing of engines by the captain, who didn't care a
tinker's last about dash, but who did put his ship at the top of the
steaming list.
A more dashing method of making the side has been observed
and is presented—though the last time this was observed, the an-
chored ship's side (ours), received dents from the approaching
ship's propeller guard—which dents, however, “do not affect the
fighting efficiency.” (Hull Report.) It is shown in Fig. 9.

Three other conditions should be noted briefly in regard to going
alongside. The first is a condition of strong tide, sea, or wind
from ahead. The general approach should be the same as noted in
Fig. 8, with the possible exception that the bow should be pointed
up more to avoid the possibility of tide, sea, or wind carrying the
bow against the anchored ship's galley deckhouse. The other ex-
treme would be that of allowing the bow to get out so far before
a forecastle line is passed to the anchored ship that it would be
impossible to force the bow back into tide, sea, or wind.
The second condition is illustrated in Fig. 10.

The solution of the above condition is based on the action of the
wind on the exposed portion of the ship's side. A caution here!
If own bow is too close to other ship, the wind acting on own stern
may throw the bow into other ship's side.
The third condition is illustrated in Fig. 11.
WIND
STOP
FIG. II
The last backing will partially save the bumping of ships which
would result from the leeway made by own ship, although the
backing might be inadvisable if the stern were in too close. In
most instances of this kind (with a strong beam wind) a relatively
good-sized “bump” may be expected, although the blow may be
softened by having the bow canted out slightly; when the “bump"
occurs, this will permit both ships to cushion it by pivoting on the
galley deck-house fender.
In all the above cases of going alongside, a 4.0 job may be con-
sidered done when own ship comes alongside with guard rails of
both ships two feet apart and with the slightest possible kick astern
on the engines ; also, when lines are handled properly. Don't allow
all hands to let go heaving lines when the ship is two feet too far
off and then spend their time at recoiling them when their use
is really necessary! A caution comes to mind. Do not follow the
solutions presented without watching the ship's movements as a

whole-do not hesitate to change speed or rudder promptly when
unusual conditions arise. If you come up parallel too far out from
the other ship, it is very easy to "warp” alongside by light use of
ahead and astern speed on your outboard engine.
Maneuvers at Piers.—Having taken up several typical cases of
getting underway from alongside and going alongside ships, a
word or two might be added with regard to maneuvers at piers.
Practically the only variance of conditions here from those shown
in preceding cases is of a transverse tidal or wind sweep. This
is noticeable at nearly all ports in varying intensities, so no par-
ticular localities will be given. It should be stated though that,
where possible, a request for tug assistance is neither cowardly nor
unseamanlike. Consider the appalled countenance of a destroyer
captain noted for his dash and nerve, who attempted to maneuver
his ship into position between two others at a navy yard dock, and
had the first lieutenant report, after securing that the crew in the
forward living compartment had a new window thirty feet long
and fourteen inches wide, through which to contemplate the glory
of the winter night!
Most all cases of getting underway from a dock with transverse
wind and tide, whether inside a pier or along a pierhead, resolve
into a solution of springing out the stern by breasting in the bow,
letting go all lines quickly when this is accomplished, backing at
two-thirds or full speed until there is open water between pier or
other ship moored to pier, using the rudder as an aid in direction,
and then easing or changing the engine speeds to complete the
maneuver and fair away to the desired heading. Here again, it
might be advisable to point out that in case of doubt, a tug will ease
the mind, if not actually accomplishing much more than could be
done without it.
In practically all cases of going into a pier or a nest moored
alongside the pier, with tide or wind on the beam at the final ap-
proach, tug assistance is recommended unless there is a generous
fifty feet beam space to enter. There are numerous solutions to
these conditions which may be found in any of the old familiar
standard editions of seamanship. The point to be emphasized
here, perhaps, is to plan the approach as shown in Fig. 12, also to
get a forecastle line to the dock promptly, and, as soon as possible,
a line from the vicinity of the motor boat skids, this latter line to

Destroyer Handling Alongside
act as an all-important temporary spring line. In connection with
this latter line, it would be well to lead it outside of everything,
bending on a heaving line carried to the forecastle, so as to get it
ashore pronto!
The difference between making a land-
ing at a pier and alongside a ship is that
in the case of a ship, it is all-important to
place the bow right, for usually and even-
tually the stern will take care of itself,
the same forces being at work on both
ships. In the case of a pier, it may be all-
important to get the stern in at the same
time. Also, at piers, currents may be
running differently inside the pier-head
line and local conditions may cause eddies
embarrassing to a stranger. Under diffi-
cult conditions, it might be well to land
alongside the pierhead, if possible, and
then to work into the slip by use of lines
Fig. 12
and moderate use of engines.
An Ethic or Two.-In concluding these notes, a hint in the di-
rection of cooperation in handling lines and “preparing the side"
is inserted. When advance notice is received that another de-
stroyer is coming alongside, the side should be cleared promptly, a
spare fender or two and the same number of heaving lines should
be dug up from the forward hold-or, if necessary and possible,
borrowed—and enough crew provided to handle the visitor's lines
with dispatch. If time provides and an anchor Aluke protrudes, the
anchor should be decked if conditions are adverse for the visitor.
It cheers the visitor's eyes to see such consideration, especially
among his own division mates.
If by chance, a slight contretemps occurs in going alongside, it
is but courtesy to send over the carpenter's mate with his “kit” to
repair stanchions and such as may have suffered.
Another point of ethics comes to mind. Conversation, except a
warning of danger, should not be attempted with a ship handler in
action, either from his own bridge or from adjacent ships. It is the
last straw for a nervous man and fills his soul with undying hatred.

Many more "wrinkles” have flashed across the writer's memory,
but time, space, and patience must be respected. After we had
worried through these notes, chewing meanwhile through our pipe-
stem, we presented the result to Captain J— of the U.S.S.
V- the morning following his experience related. It was a
very cold morning off Culebra, but the nip in the air didn't cool
the writer's ardor one quarter as much as Captain J- 's scowl
as he perused the opening paragraphs. In the next two hours,
however, it was one of those rare occasions our division was at
anchor for the morning—the situation eased, and during the dis-
cussion of destroyer handling, Captain J-- uttered an expressive
fancy which has stuck in our memory and is quoted in closing :
“Destroyers are whimsical crafts, of great power, quick to respond
to keen handling, and a pleasure to those seamen who treat them
with just appreciation of their sensitive natures.”
