THE ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER AND THE
FUTURE OF THE NAVY
BY ADMIRAL E. W. EBERLE, U. S. Navy, Chief of NAVAL
OPERATIONS
CINCE the day the ship made possible the transportation of
merchandise by sea the great nations of the world have been
found among those having extensive coast lines. History
proves that world power is measured by sea power and that na-
tional prosperity can continue only so long as a nation is willing
to maintain its sea power commensurate with its prosperity.
What are the fundamental factors of sea power?
They are:
1. Naval strength sufficient to insure free movement of na-
tional sea-borne trade.
2. A merchant marine of sufficient size and suitable charac-
teristics to carry the nation's products to the markets of
the world, to bring from such markets the products re-
quired for national prosperity, and, in time of war, to
carry on essential war time trade and to furnish auxil-
iaries and transportation for naval and army forces.
3. A sufficient number of well located and suitably equipped
and defended bases throughout the world, to afford sup-
port and protection to commerce, and operating bases for
the fleet.
In recent years the people of the United States have come to
realize the necessity for an American merchant marine, and the
government, by its support of the Shipping Board and Emergency
Fleet Corporation, has shown its appreciation of the value of the
merchant marine as a fundamental factor of sea power.
The value of a merchant marine increases with each restriction
in naval armaments. If war ships were abolished, the merchant
marines of the nations would have the potential power of navies.
It is, therefore, essential that the people of this nation realize that

restriction in naval armament imposes the necessity for a stronger
merchant marine.
In respect to well located and suitably equipped and defended
bases, the United States is badly handicapped by the fact that most
of the best bases of the world were in the hands of comparatively
strong nations when the United States was founded. For many
years our traditional policy of isolation prevented attempts to
obtain suitable bases.
As a result of the war with Spain, the United States came into
possession of the Philippines and Porto Rico and, through the
aroused nationalism resulting from that war, entered into an era
of industrial and commercial activity which placed it in the fore-
front of world powers.
Thirty years ago we had no possessions outside of the conti-
nental United States except Alaska. Since that time we have ac-
quired the Philippines, Samoa, Guam, Hawaiian Islands, Porto
Rico, Panama Canal Zone, Guantanamo, and the Virgin Islands.
While it cannot be said that many of these were obtained with a
view to their use as bases, the change in policy which permitted
their acquisition was the result of a tardy recognition of the value
of bases as a factor of sea power.
The third fundamental factor of sea power is naval strength.
What is naval strength ?
In the days when the word "navy” became of general use,
weapons and ships were primitive. Control of sea communications
could be exercised only by the surface ships. As a result of this
condition the word navy was applied to forces composed of ships
alone, and even in the present day, has, to most people, this re-
stricted meaning. As a result of this restricted interpretation, the
reason for a navy has, to some extent, been lost sight of, and we
now find a tendency, as indicated by the air service advocates,
to confine the equipment of the Navy to ships and that which can
be operated from ships.
Efficiency in these modern days is measured by two factors:
first, tools or equipment suitable to the performance of the task;
second, skill in use of such tools or equipment. But, before tools
can be selected or skill acquired there must be a definite assignment
of a task. The task assigned to the Navy in war is the control of
vital lines of sea communication. The tools required are surface

ships, submarines, and aircraft. The necessary skill can be ac-
quired only by using these tools in cooperation.
If the Navy is to perform its task effectively there must be an
acceptance of a broad definition of the word navy. The people
and the government must recognize that the Navy is that branch
of the national defense which is charged with the control of vital
lines of sea communications. This is a distinct branch of na-
tional defense and, whereas, in the past surface ships have been
the chief tools, it should be recognized that with changes in the
methods of conducting war the tools may change. The Navy
must comprise such types of vessels and equipment as are best
fitted to accomplish its task. Any weapons or equipment, or any
types of forces which can be used effectively in the accomplish-
ment of its task, legitimately belong to the Navy.
This principle has been recognized in the past by the organiza-
tion of the Marine Corps to assist the Navy in defending or
seizing temporary bases for fleet operations and in the provision
of shore establishments for the construction of ships, guns, tor-
pedoes, and so forth; the manufacture of experimental aircraft,
the preparation of charts and books (such as the Nautical Al-
manac) used in navigation of ships and by aircraft engaged in
oversea flights.
It is equally applicable to the use by the Navy of aircraft based
on shore. Whether or not such aircraft should be operated by
the Navy depends entirely on the function they are to perform.
Aircraft operating with a view to the control of sea communica-
tions must be coordinated in their operations with vessels engaged
in similar duties, and with the control and routing of shipping
which is a naval function.
The NAVAL FORCES
The naval forces of the nation are divided into three major
subdivisions, the fleet, the naval transportation service, and local
defense forces.
The Fleet.–Capital ship strength is limited by treaty and no
further capital ship construction can be undertaken before 1931.
The tonnage of aircraft carriers of more than 10,000 tons dis-
placement is also limited, but the United States, even when the
Saratoga and Lexington are completed, will not be up to allowed

Elements of Sea Power
strength. The construction of additional aircraft carrier tonnage
must be undertaken if the Navy is to maintain the proper air
strength of the fleet.
In modern cruisers the United States Navy is far below its
proper strength. This type is limited in size and armament by
the treaty, but there is no restriction as to numbers. To attain
a cruiser ratio with Great Britain and Japan, the same as that
accepted for capital ships, we need twenty additional cruisers of
10,000 tons displacement.
In submarines the United States is superior in vessels of the
coastal type, but is much inferior in vessels capable of operating
with the fleet. The need for large submarines is urgent.
The operation of destroyers simulating war conditions con-
tinues to emphasize the need for destroyer leaders. Although
we possess a superiority in destroyers, many of these vessels are
old and none has been authorized since 1917. Japan is building
destroyers superior to our destroyers in size, speed, and arma-
ment. Newspaper reports indicate that Great Britain will adopt
a plan for constructing nine destroyers yearly. The superiority
we now possess will rapidly diminish with time, and with the
new construction of destroyers by Great Britain and Japan.
In naval aviation the developments during the past year have
been greater than ever before. The increase in the number of
planes capable of operations with the fleet has permitted the fur-
ther development of standard practice instructions for aircraft
operations, and tactical exercises have furnished opportunities
for the operation of aircraft in the simulation of war.
Preparations are being made to place the Lexington and Sara-
toga in commission with full aviation completements during 1926.
Three navy planes are preparing for a flight from the west
coast to Hawaii. This is the longest non-stop flight ever attempted
over the sea. The planes to be employed are of two designs de-
veloped by the Navy for scouting purposes.
The Secretary of the Navy has directed that a course in aviation
shall constitute part of the Naval Academy curriculum. In the
case of the class of 1926 a portion of this class will take the
course after graduation but before assignment to duty, while one
third of the class has completed the ground school course this
summer. This course should provide officers with a knowledge of

aviation and it is hoped that it will increase interest and requests
for further training in aviation.
During the past year the high standard of efficiency in gunnery
and engineering performances has been maintained. Tactical,
strategical, and joint army and navy exercises have been conducted.
The joint army and navy exercises conducted in the Hawaiian
Islands during April, 1925, was the most extensive exercise of
this nature ever conducted by United States forces and afforded
excellent training for large units of the Army, Navy, and Marine
Corps.
The Naval Transportation Service.—It is impracticable to main-
tain in the Navy in time of peace the great number of auxiliaries,
storeships, tankers, colliers, and so forth required during war for
the supply and transportation of army and navy forces. The
merchant marine constitutes the source from which the govern-
ment may obtain such vessels. The vessels so obtained during
war are assigned to the fleet or to the naval transportation service.
Because of the menace of the submarine during the World War,
the Navy took over and manned the greater portion of all United
States vessels engaged in transportation of troops and stores for
our forces abroad. At one period during the World War the
number of ships operated by the naval transportation service
reached the enormous total of 558.
It will be seen from the above that the merchant marine is a
most important factor in sea power. Without adequate supply
our fleet is limited to its radius of action from some well stocked
naval base. With an adequate supply of fuel, food, and other
necessities the fleet can operate anywhere in the world, so long as
the lines of communication can be controlled.
The Local Defense Forces comprise the vessels and aircraft
operating under the commandants of naval districts for the pro-
tection of coastal sea areas. This includes a service of information
to determine the presence of enemy forces, and combat forces to
destroy any enemy forces located.
The local defense forces are concerned only with the defense
against secondary operation. Against primary or major opera-
tions the fleet would be used.
There has been an attempt to remove from naval jurisdiction
all aircraft based on shore. Such policy is based upon a consid-

eration of the type of weapons to be employed and not on the
result to be accomplished, and is unsound.
The Navy requires aircraft for use from shore bases as a part
of the naval local defense forces and may further require them in
support of the fleet against a superior fleet. Such air forces are
a legitimate part of the naval force and the Navy would be reduced
in efficiency for the performance of its task if these were removed
from navy jurisdiction.
Unity of command over all forces employed in a given operation
or for the accomplishment of a definite task was one of the great
lessons of the World War which should not be forgotten.
The Future of the United States Navy.—If the people of the
United States forget the value of sea power as they did after the
Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Civil War, the future of
the Navy is not bright; but if the value of sea power is recognized
as it was after the war with Spain, and the nation enters into a
period of prosperity such as followed that war, the Navy should
have a brilliant future. Then the Navy will be recognized as a
branch of the government charged with a particular task.
The future of the Navy may be said to rest upon the indoctrina-
tion of the people of the nation with three fundamental truths :
First: National strength and prosperity depend upon the main-
tenance of adequate sea power.
Second: Sea power comprises the Navy, the merchant marine,
and suitable bases.
Third: The Navy is that branch of the national defense charged
with the control of communications by sea irrespective of whether
such control is exercised by surface ships, submarines, or aircraft.
