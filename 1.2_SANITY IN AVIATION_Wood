SANITY IN AVIATION
By LIEUTENANT COMMANDER RALPH WOOD, U. S. NAVY
THERE has recently reoccurred a flood of wild statements
and loose generalization relative to aviation in general and
naval aviation in particular. This has been occasioned by
the rather passionate though misguided efforts of those addicted
to the phantom of a so-called United Air Service. In every age it
appears that some human hope reaches out for its moon of uni-
versal panacea. Just now if we could believe, we are assured that
a "united air service” will cure all of our ills, do away forever with
the necessity of an army and navy, reduce taxes and generally
bring in the millenium.
One of the misleading ideas which has been advanced by avia-
tion enthusiasts, and one which, having been accepted by the public
has done real harm to aviation, is the widely published statement
that aviation is cheap; that it is an inexpensive method of warfare.
Careful study of available figures does not bear out this statement.
The idea that one plane with one bomb can completely destroy
one battleship, in view of the fact that the plane costs but $20,000
while the battleship costs $40,000,000 apparently presents an im-
mediate solution of the financial problems attending national in-
surance. However, upon investigation, we find that to get this
one bomber into position requires the services of many other
planes. In the first place, to insure that a reasonable number of
planes reach their objective it is necessary that a whole squadron
ranging in strength from eighteen to thirty-six be launched. To
protect this squadron in its mission, combat planes in the propor-
tions of two or three to one must be provided. Furthermore, such
is the present state of the art of aviation in regard to reliability
and operating radius that in order to keep one plane in the air,
four planes must be available. One begins to notice now how our
one plane has suddenly multiplied itself into the hundred class.
Then with this number of planes to maintain we find it necessary
to retain the services of still more planes at headquarters for mes-

senger and liaison service. Also, if the enemy is not obliging
enough to disclose his whereabouts, we must have squadrons of
scout planes to go out and find him.
Going still farther, we see that a base must be provided for all
of this aerial equipment which includes large landing areas, numer-
ous big hangars, gasoline storage tanks, trucks, store houses for
spares, barracks for mechanics and guard troops. The personnel
as one can imagine is not small. For one thing, aviation demands
a much larger proportion of officer strength than does any other
combat arm. There is at least one officer in every plane and, in
many, two are required. About this time we find also that our
$20,000 plane has vanished, for planes to do the work outlined
range from $20,000 up to $100,000 so that our average cost rises
to approximately $40,000 or $50,000. Our attention is also drawn
to the fact that, whereas the “official” life of a battleship is ac-
cepted as fifteen years, a plane's life is but three. Furthermore,
during that three years the plane's different parts will have been
replaced at least once. In other words, at the end of three years
we will have to write the plane off our books at twice its original
value. Without complex analysis it is still readily apparent that
our aviation endeavor is going to cost very nearly as much as does
the target.
The above assumptions have followed in general the ideas of
masses of planes with which our aviation enthusiasts so easily
darken the skies, and furthermore consider the easiest problem,
that in which the enemy calmly comes into our immediate vicinity
courting combat.
Suppose, however, he is inconsiderate enough to stay a few
hundred miles at sea and from this position throttle the commerce
and world-wide communications of the country? It is true that
proponents of the plane (extremists) blithely send the planes over-
seas to where the enemy may happen to be, but in practice this is
not so easily done. The army world cruisers (a modified navy
type torpedo plane) may be accepted as a fair sample of a modern
plane. The longest flight made by these planes was approximately
900 miles. To achieve this distance extra tanks of gasoline were
built into the plane. This increased weight precluded the possi-
bility of carrying any military load such as bombs, torpedoes, guns
and ammunition. In order to accomplish a strictly military mis-

sion this peace time overseas travel melts like snow in the sun. In
placing the machine guns, ammunition, bombs and bomb sights in
the plane, gasoline must be sacrificed. When the machine is thus
equipped we find her capable, at her most economical speed, of
traveling about 400 miles, 200 off shore and 200 back. Not so good
if that is our sole reliance against ships that roam the seven seas.
In order then to bring our aviation threat to the enemy ship we
are forced to the consideration of an airplane carrier. Let us see
what that procedure involves. We can build two real carriers
under the treaty, with a possibility of development some time in
the future of a carrier within the treaty restrictions of 10,000
tons. On each of these large carriers, costing by the way a matter
of forty to forty-five millions each, we can crowd seventy assorted
planes. Not all can be bombers because some fighting planes must
be provided. If the carrier is to be used to seek out and engage
our enemy battleship, our hordes of planes shrink to 140, of which
possibly one third are bombers. And as these planes must be man-
handled from holds and hangar decks onto the flying deck and from
there flown off, proper allowance in time must be made for this
maneuver. From the time the first plane takes the air until the
last is off may take an hour at a minimum. To recover the planes
will take no less time so that one hour is cut off the cruising time
of the planes. This means that our carrier must approach that
much closer to the target. In doing so she naturally subjects her-
self to the ordinary hazards of torpedo and gun attack with the
added possibility that one or two enemy planes with light bombs
may so cripple her large flying deck as to prevent the recovery of
our planes.
The easiest problem for the defense was shown to be costly but
the second problem is more costly still. We see that the lure of
cheap warfare held out by aviation extremists vanishes like mist.
We can dispense with the cheapness idea of aviation. It is most
decidedly not a cheap weapon but a very expensive one.
There are two other statements advanced from time to time in
regard to naval aviation which will not bear the light of actual fact.
One is that the older and directing heads of the Navy are antag-
onistic to and oppose the progress of aviation. Also that the
younger officers are so muzzled that the true condition (asserted

to be backward) of naval aviation is not permitted to be known.
Neither of these statements is true.
In performance of his aviation duty the writer has had at vari-
ous times contact with many naval officers of high rank. Unfail-
ingly and without exception, these officers have evidenced in speech
and action their sincere interest in the advancement of the art of
aviation. They have been most sympathetic in their attitude toward
the demands of naval aviation and have gone much more than
half way in fostering and encouraging this arm of the Navy. How
anyone in a responsible position could be more liberal minded and
interested in the development of aviation than the present com-
manders-in-chief of the United States fleet and battle fleet and still
be human it is hard to see. Such officers have many factors to con-
sider in the proper rounding out of their duties and it is safe to
say that aviation has received and is receiving more than its pro-
portionate share of their attention. They recognize the fact that
aviation although important is but one factor among many that
must be considered when modern warfare is contemplated.
As for the statement that younger naval officers are muzzled, the
writer from experience knows nothing further from the truth.
From his own observation during eighteen years of naval service
he has never elsewhere observed the latitude allowed and sympa-
thetic interest taken in the ideas advanced by younger officers. This
is true not only within the aviation specialty itself, but in contact
between such specialists and older line officers who have previously
had little operating contact with aviation.
One conclusive proof of the interest which the older and ex-
perienced officers have taken in regard to aviation may be cited
in the matter of war plans. All that the writer has seen and is
familiar with have made careful and far-sighted provision for the
proper developnient of naval aviation facilities and employment.
Not only this, but these practical minded sailors have gone one step
farther, and in accepting the prophecies of our own aviation ex-
perts, have made proper and ample provision for the advantageous
employment of such advance in naval aviation as it is possible to
conceive today.
Those charged with the material development of aviation in the
Navy have been far from lagging in their efforts. In fact, the
United States Navy is responsible for a considerable part of the

advance which has been made in aviation since the war. With
characteristic navy attitude no great shouting has accompanied
these accomplishments. Being slightly irritated by the constant
buzzing and stinging of irresponsible critics, the Navy decided to
publish some of their accomplishments. So stopping the regular
grind for a short time the Navy went out and annexed the record
for the fastest land plane in the world, then the record for the
fastest seaplane in the world, (we already had the Atlantic flight,
by Commander Read under our belt), and then one after another
numerous duration, weight and altitude world records. Then we
went back to work and left the rest to shoot at our marks. The
Navy has not considered it worth the cost to keep actively in the
racing game. Our money is expended in service craft and their
operation. But when called upon we need take nobody's slip
stream. The Navy has developed the first reliable rigid, a system
of water recovery from exhaust gases, reliable air cooled motors
and several special aeronautical engines which for ruggedness and
performance are well to the front. The Navy has further per-
fected the catapult to the point where the commander-in-chief,
battle fleet, is justified in publishing the following comment:
The commander-in-chief, battle fleet, is pleased to note that catapulting
of planes has now progressed sufficiently to warrant such operations when-
ever opportunity permits and plane service is desired.
This progress has been made possible only through the concerted efforts
of all concerned and the general confidence of the fleet's personnel results
from the many successful catapult shots to date.
The commander-in-chief, battle fleet, desires that every effort be made
to continue this development and that no failures or casualties, particularly
those involving material and possible of predetermination, occur to mar the
established good record or shake the confidence of the operating personnel.
When critics state that the Navy has not kept and is not keeping
abreast of aviation advancement they are right only in that the
Navy is leading in much of it.
Finally, those personally interested in a so-called "united air
service” talk in large round generalities of the savings and econ-
omies to be realized by an amalgamation. Careful analysis will
not disclose these economies. It is a fact which will not down that
air mail, army and navy requirements are different one from the
other, that the equipment proper for one is improper for the other,

that the personnel of one performs duties almost totally different
from the others. For mind you, the ability to conduct a plane
about on its legitimate business is the least of a properly trained
aviator's duties.
To discuss the naval arm simply, we take our men and officers
from the same training and concentration centers as do the other
naval branches. Naval aviators must be familiar with ships and
be sea-going, they must understand the tactics and strategy of
scout ships, destroyers, submarines and battleships and their har-
monious employment as fleets. They must have an intimate knowl-
edge of the methods of gun control, because one of their important
jobs is in connection therewith.
A so-called "united air force” would be required to supply per-
sonnel as well fitted to naval needs, and in addition, personnel to
serve the Army in its manifold duties. Is one man to be able to
do both? Very improbable. There is a limit to human endeavor.
If two sets of personnel are to be developed within one organiza-
tion with all the special equipment demanded by the circumstances,
the organization will be much like a hen attempting the rearing of
one chick and one duck. There will be plenty of distraction.
Some people stress present duplication of effort and feel this
will be cured by amalgamation of all aviation. But is there dupli-
cation ? And if there is, will it be cured? As a matter of fact
there is practically no duplication of effort as regards the present
administration of aviation under the Army and Navy. Planes
and engines, ordered from manufacturers are not similar for the
two services, nor are they likely to be except in special instances.
Amalgamation of repair stations would not effect economies.
Against a prevalent belief that manufacturing under one head is
economical, we find that little or no manufacturing is done by the
services. Repair and overhaul consists mainly in replacement and
adjustment of parts and men qualified to work on one engine may
not be qualified to work on another.
On the other hand, amalgamation of the two air services would
immediately introduce duplication from the top to the bottom.
First, we duplicate a whole new department in the government
with a secretary, assistant secretaries, heads of bureaus, office
space, clerks and messengers. There would be another recruiting
bureau and staff, another academy, similar to West Point and

Annapolis, for the training of officer personnel and training depots
for the enlisted men. We would find the need for a corps of flight
surgeons, a corps of quartermasters or pay officers, a corps of de-
signers. The new service would take over some of the present air
stations but there would immediately arise the need for acquisition
. of new sites. New and more buildings, motor boats, trucks and
horses formerly supplied gratis by the mother services must be
purchased. And finally there must be obtained carriers and tenders
with all the appurtenances under control of the new service. If
this does not entail duplication, what does ? And then picture the
air commodore and the fleet admiral getting together to give battle
to the enemy. Or the commanding general and air commodore in
land warfare! Each would be independent and yet each needing
the other. What, without economy and lacking efficiency, is the
excuse for this new service?
Every weapon has not only its possibilities, but also its limita-
tions. Those who would master a weapon must be familiar with
those limitations if they are to develop that weapon's utmost ex-
ecution. In discussing aviation, enthusiastic proponents have
drawn largely from future possibilities but have neglected the in-
herent limitations of aircraft. The limitations of aircraft are
many, and realizing this fact, the Navy has busied itself in incor-
porating the aviation branch within the fleet so that strength is
afforded aircraft where they are weakest in order that they may,
when the opportunity presents, deliver their maximum war effort.
Those who maintain that the Navy is derelict in its development
of aviation within the limits set by the state of advancement of
the art and the money provided by Congress do so with no founda-
tion in fact. It is well for the country to know this. It is also
well for the country to remember that the personnel operating our
aircraft have passed all tests required for other naval personnel ;
they have performed the same duties on the bridge, in the turret
and in the engine room. They know from experience the kind of
service the Navy demands and are prepared and anxious to give it.
