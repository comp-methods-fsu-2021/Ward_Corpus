A BALANCED FLEET FOR THE UNITED
STATES NAVY
By CAPTAIN J. K. TaussIG, U. S. Navy
Motto: A just man armed keepeth his house in order.
EDITOR's Note: The author wrote and submitted the following article
in December, 1924, before the publication of the report of the special board
appointed by an order of the Secretary of the Navy, to consider a policy
of the Navy Department "with reference to the up-keep of the Navy in
its various branches."
LOREWORD.—The Navy is a complex organization. It is
i composed of the fleet and the shore establishment, both of
which are inseparably involved with the heterogeneous mat-
ters of personnel, material and supplies, together with all of their
complications of organization, administration, maintenance and
command.
The shore establishment is for the fleet. Various political and
economical factors enter at times to becloud this fact. Neverthe-
less, in the main, the magnitude and complexities of the shore es-
tablishment are dependent on the size of the fleet together with the
numbers, character and disposition of the vessels that compose it.
The fleet, then, having the foundation on which the entire naval
organization is built, it is evident that the composition of this fleet
is a matter of the greatest importance to the Navy and to the
country.
The fleet in itself is an intricate organization, made up of many
diversified elements. But, in the popular sense, the fleet is only
the ships that compose it. It is in this popular sense that the sub-

ject of a balanced feet will be considered in this paper. What will
be examined into is for the purpose of determining the character
and the number of the combatant ships that should compose our
fleet in order that it will be most efficiently able to perform the
duties required of the Navy should there be another war.
Policy and the Navy.—The fleet being that part of the Navy
through which its power is exerted, it is essential, before taking
up its functions, to determine exactly what the Navy is for. It is
asserted and conceded that the Navy is the country's first line of
defense, but this expresses, only in a limited sense, the true reason
for the existence of the Navy. It has functions which are much
broader than that signified in the popular phrase, “First line of
defense.”
In 1922 the Secretary of the Navy directed the general board to
formulate a United States naval policy. The completed work,
which was approved by the Secretary, begins with a definition of
naval policy as follows:
Naval policy is the system of principles, and the general terms of their
application, governing the development, organization, maintenance, training
and operation of a navy. It is based on and designed to support national
policies and American interests. It comprehends the questions of number,
size, type and distribution of naval vessels and stations, the character and
number of the personnel, and the character of peace and war operations.
The second paragraph of the general board's report defines the
"fundamental naval policy of the United States” in the following
sentence:
The Navy of the United States should be maintained in sufficient strength
to support its policies and its commerce, and to guard its continental and
overseas possessions.
We thus see that the real reason for having a Navy is for the
purpose of supporting the policies of the government. The pro-
tection of American interests, the supporting of commerce, and the
guarding of our continental and overseas possessions are, broadly
speaking, the basis on which our more definite national policies are
formed. It is these definite national policies, having an inter-
national significance, which form the basis for our naval policy.
The fundamental naval policy of the United States requires the
maintenance of the Navy in sufficient strength to support the na-
tional policies. Therefore, in order to determine this strength,

we must ascertain whither the supporting of these policies may
lead us. For illustrative purposes we will consider only two of
them: the Monroe Doctrine, and the Open Door in China.
The Monroe Doctrine has been in operation for a century. It
is for the purpose of keeping the Americas for the Americans.
It denies to the Old World countries the right further to colonize
or to attain land on this continent. For any foreign nation or
nations to overthrow this policy it would be necessary for them to
bring their armed forces to, or near to, us. If this were the only
foreign policy which might in the future involve us in war, it
could reasonably be argued that the Navy of the United States
must be maintained only for defensive purposes.
On the other hand, an entirely different situation is presented in
considering the Open Door. This national policy is for the pur-
pose of maintaining the integrity of China and for insuring to all
countries equal rights and opportunities in their dealings there.
To many Americans the adherence to such a policy is extreme
foolishness. This feeling is due to a failure to understand the
significance of events which led up to its announcement by Mr.
John Hay. With accurate vision he saw what it means to the
United States to have an Open Door in China. There is a country
of 400,000,000 peoples, the markets of which are being opened to
the world. European powers were taking every means, honorable
and otherwise, to gain spheres of influence in China which would
not only give them political dominance but also commercial and
economic control over this vast empire. The Open Door policy
announced by Mr. Hay was asserted for the purpose of insuring
to the United States equal rights for carrying on trade there. As
the United States becomes more and more thickly populated, and
as manufacturing increases as a means of supporting our people,
we must go farther and farther afield to obtain markets for our
goods. China, as a field for commercial enterprise is of great im-
portance to this country, and this importance will continue to grow.
Suppose, then, foreign opposition to this policy should involve us
in war. Could we enforce our will in regard to the maintenance of
the Open Door by having a navy built only with the view to de-
fending our own shores and possessions ? Could we win such a
war by keeping our fleet at home? It does not take much per-
spicacity to realize that in order to support our policy against

opposition in China we would have to exert power in the Far East.
The only way to exert such power, after diplomacy has failed, is
through our armed forces—first the Navy and then the Army. In
other words, in order to support such a national policy as the Open
Door, we do not want a navy primarily for defense, as in the case
of the Monroe Doctrine, but, if need be, we must have a navy for
offense also. And this condition must be accepted as a truism as
long as there are any national policies involving international
affairs that may lead to a war, the theater of operations of which
will not be near our home shores.
These two examples have been cited for the purpose of demon-
strating the fallibility of the general popular belief that the Navy
is only for our first line of defense. In the political sense this is
true in the meaning that the Navy is for the support or defense of
our policies. In the naval or military sense this idea holds true
only when the conflict in policy which may lead to a war is one in
which the war will be fought out near or on our own shores.
The Function of the Fleet.—The fleet being that part of the
Navy which embodies the kinetic power for waging war, its com-
position, insofar as ships are concerned, must depend upon the
kind of war we may be called upon to wage. It has been shown
that the Navy as a whole, while primarily for the defense of na-
tional policies, must be maintained so as to be able to carry on
either defensive warfare or offensive warfare in accordance with
the conflict in international policy that may bring on the war.
Defensive and offensive warfare in this broad sense refer to what
are generally known as campaigns, the significance being that the
Navy operates either on the broad strategic defensive or on the
broad strategic offensive. The distinction between strategic and
tactical action must be emphasized in order clearly to understand
the true function of the fleet.
Strategy, in general, deals with all operations prior to an en-
gagement. Tactics deals with the battle after the fleets are within
contact. Good strategy results in obtaining suitable initial positions
in sufficient strength, from which to begin the fight. Good tactics
results in taking advantage of the positions so as to win the fight.
History has shown, the game board shows, and wars in the
future will show, that whatever strategic attitude the Navy assumes
in any campaign, be it defensive or offensive, the tactical attitude,

'
when it comes to fighting, must be offensive if the battle is to be
won. A purely passive defensive has never yet won a battle. It
neglects the great advantage to be gained by initiative. It is similar
in its action to that of a prize fighter who protects himself only
by covering up. He may delay to some extent the ultimate defeat,
but he does not hurt his opponent. In order to injure the adver-
sary he must strike out, he must take offensive action as exempli-
fied in aggressive tactics. It is thus with fleets. If fleets are to
win battles they must strike and strike hard. It will not avail to
cover up in defensive attitude.
In the last analysis, then, the chief strategical function of the
fleet is to gain and maintain control of the sea. The chief tactical
function, whatever may be the strategic attitude of the navy as a
whole, is to win battles. In order to win battles, the fleet must
fight offensively. In order to fight offensively to the best advantage
it must be so constituted that the elements which compose it bear
the proper relationship to each other. It is this relationship that
forms the basis for determining what vessels should constitute the
balanced fleet.
Surface Ships Versus Submarines and Aircraft.-In order to
obtain and maintain a suitable balance between the vessels which
ccmpose the fleet, it is first necessary to establish the general
classes of vessels required. A majority of those who have made a
study of naval developments and naval warfare assert that surface
ships, as exemplified by the battleship type, are still the backbone
of the fleet. However, there is a growing school in support of the
contention that the capital ship has seen its day, and is to be re-
placed by aircraft and subsurface craft. Perhaps a brief historical
review of the developments of various naval weapons and their
effect on the fleet up to the present time may aid in forming judg-
ment as to whether there are sound reasons for supporting the
contentions of those who hold that the battleship is doomed..
For many years the gun with its carrier has been the chief naval
weapon. Periodically, there is brought to the fore a new instru-
ment either in the form of what may literally be termed a weapon,
or which taken in conjunction with its carrier is a weapon in the
figurative sense, the sponsors of which, in each case, shout the
shibboleth: “The battleship is doomed.” The chief of these
weapons are the ram, torpedo, bomb, torpedo boat, submarine, and

now, aircraft. In each case, whatever may have been the naval
support, there was considerable popular and political backing,
owing to the ever-recurring endeavor to get a cheap substitute for
the expensive surface ships which were continuously increasing in
size, power and cost. Many of the most ardent advocates of these
various weapons were, and still are, those who, no matter what
the available evidence, always hope to get something for nothing.
In each of the aforementioned weapons it looked for a while as
if the success proclaimed for it would be met. Some of them did
undeniably meet with considerable initial success, due to the his-
torical fact that in warfare new implements of offensive have, in
the beginning, been one stride ahead of the means of defense.
When the new offensive weapon demonstrates an ability to inflict
damage, and not until then, are the antidotes developed.
The sponsors of the ram caused the building of a special ship,
the Katahdin, which had only this means of offense. Then came a
period when all of the chief naval powers required their marine
architects to design nearly all fighting ships with ram bows. There
were a number of visionaries who depicted a swarm of small
Katahdins sinking the fewer larger enemy ships by ramming. But
the threat of the ram was met in the increased speed of the larger
ships, and in improved gun fire. The ram soon passed into a state
of innocuous desuetude where it has since remained.
The bomb had sufficient advocates to force the building of the
special dynamite ship, the Vesuvius. The great destructive effect
that would be produced by the hurling of these immense explosive
projectiles through the air was visualized. But here again the
advance in gunnery denied to the bomb-carrying vessels the priv-
ilege of getting close enough to the larger ships to be dangerous.
So the bomb in naval warfare passed into oblivion, there to remain
until the recent developments in aircraft have again brought it to
the front.
The automobile torpedo, which, unlike projectiles hurled through
the air, has its medium in the water, was introduced. A realiza-
tion of its potential effectiveness was immediately appreciated, pro-
vided the handicap of its short range could be overcome. This
led to the development, first of the torpedo boat, and then of the
submarine, as conveyors for the torpedo. What has been the his-
tory of these vessels ?

A Balanced Fleet for the Navy
Consider the torpedo boat. Originally these were small, com-
paratively (for those days) high-speed vessels, which, through
stress of numbers and by reason of their maneuverability, were
expected to attain positions that would enable them to overwhelm
the larger ships. This threat was effectively met in a number of
ways. The defensive and offensive qualities of the larger ships
were improved by giving them added speed, additional underwater
protection, and better secondary battery guns, both as to rapidity
of fire and ballistic qualities. Then, following the well known
axiom that like kills like, larger torpedo boats were built to prey
upon the smaller ones, and then again still larger ones, resulting
finally in the destroyer which has now entirely removed the tor-
pedo boat from the field. The destroyer has remained as the chief
carrier of torpedoes on the surface. However, it has remained not
as the successor of the battleship, but as an auxiliary to that vessel.
As to the submarine. Even prior to the Great War, while the
underwater craft were still much undeveloped, there were those
who held that the advent of the submarine proclaimed the doom of
the surface-fighting ship. However, except in the early stages of
the war, prior to defensive means having been developed, the sub-
marine did not do much effective work against surface-fighting
ships. It was the allied surface ships that prevented the German
surface ships from operating against commerce. This forced the
Germans to employ submarines as commerce destroyers, but these
submarines could not prevent the Allies from continuing to use
surface vessels in the theater of operations. It was these Allied
surface vessels which, in the main, eventually caused the failure of
the submarine campaign and the ultimate defeat of the Central
Powers. The offensive employment of numerous surface craft
fitted with depth charges, the arming of merchant ships, the de-
velopment of listening devices, the development of the convoy
system-all these together, made the employment of the submarine
against surface craft less and less effective. There will long con-
tinue to be heard the voice of those who proclaim that the sub-
marines almost won the war for Germany. Be that as it may, it
was simply due to the new offense being initially ahead of the
defense. That the German submarines did not win the war for the
Germans was due entirely to the Allied surface craft--the smaller
ones, in their kinetic power, and the larger ones in their potential

power, thereby enabling the smaller ones to operate unmolested by
German ships.
The submarine is developing and will continue to do so. Like-
wise, the offensive means to be used against it will improve. This
type of vessel has not yet been employed tactically in a fleet action.
Up to the present it must still be regarded as a weapon of oppor-
tunity against capital ships. It has come to remain, like the de-
stroyer, as an adjunct of the fleet, but not to replace the surface
vessels. The submarine will not displace the capital ship as the
chief element of the fleet until such time as it develops speed,
power and maneuverability that will enable it to exert the power
embodied in the battleship. This time is not yet in sight.
With the advent of aircraft, the bomb, which had fallen by the
wayside owing to the lack of suitable conveyance to get it within
striking distance of its selected target, returned to give those who
are forever seeking the Nemesis of the battleship another oppor-
tunity for publicity. Again is heard the shibboleth, “The battle-
ship is doomed.”
The prediction of supremacy for aircraft in the future is based
on two assumptions. The first of these is that airplanes have
reached the stage of development which permit them to carry
bombs containing sufficient explosive power to destroy surface
craft. The second is that the offensive power of the planes appears
superior to the defensive developments against them.
Many base their conviction of the supremacy of aircraft on the
destructive effect of the bombs as exemplified in experiments
against undefended surface vessels. Bombs were dropped which
sank ships. The ships were relying only on their structural
strength to keep them afloat. They were making no offensive-
defense. Therefore, no sound conclusions can be reached in re-
gard to such experiments other than the already well known fact
that sufficient high explosives brought into contact with any body
will destroy that body, whatever may be the carrying medium. The
claim for the supremacy of aircraft over surface vessels is based
solely on a one-sided argument. There is a failure to appreciate
that under the same conditions for the attack, a single destroyer
or a single submarine could sink the ship in less time than was done
by a whole flight of aircraft, and with much less expense and
waste of ammunition.

A Balanced Fleet for the Navy
For those who are banking on the present seemingly superior
offensive properties of aircraft in comparision with the defensive
means, the history of the torpedo boat and the submarine are over-
looked. As the damaging effect of the torpedo has been lessened
by improved under-water construction of the larger ships, just so
can we reasonably expect the damaging effect of bombs to be les-
sened by improved above-water, as well as under-water, construc-
tion. As the carrier of the torpedo has met with increased difficulty
in getting within striking distance of the larger ships owing to
increased efficiency of secondary battery guns, just so can we be
insured of increased difficulty for aircraft to get their bombs with-
in striking distance of their targets owing to increased efficiency
in anti-aircraft guns. As the menace of the surface and subsur-
face torpedo-carrying craft was met by the employment of similar
craft against them, just so can we rely on the menace from air-
planes to be met by the employment of airplanes against them.
Aside from the immediate destructive effect that may be em-
bodied in Aying vessels under conditions especially favorable to
them, there are many things which are fundamentally against
them. Some of these are the effect of weather, their employment
teing limited or even impracticable under many conditions when
surface craft can operate with success; their reliance on surface
ships as bases when operating at long distances from shore; the
effects of derangement of machinery, which, when they occur, im-
mediately put them out of action. In fact, successful aircraft
operations in force across the sea cannot be conducted without the
aid of surface vessels, while the surface ships are not dependent
on aircraft. There will continue to be wonderful advances in the
science of Aying; but until the time comes when in war we can
rely on aircraft to carry the men, the stores, the fuel and the guns
that were carried by surface craft of all descriptions in the last
war, it is unreasonable to expect Aying machines to make the sur-
face vessels obsolete. The aircraft have come to remain, both for
commercial purposes and for naval purposes. In the latter sense
they have come not to replace the surface ships, but, like the de-
stroyer and the submarine, to remain as useful and indispensable
auxiliaries to the surface vessels.
Thus our fleet to be efficient and prepared must be composed of
surface ships, submarines and aircraft. Owing to inherent ad-

vantages of reliability, habitability, capacity for power and gen-
eral all-round capability the surface ships are, and will continue to
be, the main reliance for carrying on successful warfare. To in-
crease the effectiveness of their operations and in some cases, to
make their operations possible, the surface vessels must be aug-
mented by submarines and aircraft.
The Backbone of the Fleet.--It has been concluded that the sur-
face vessels form the general class of ships on which main reliance
must be placed for carrying on successful warfare. The next step
in ascertaining the composition of the balanced fleet is the deter-
mination of what type of surface ship should form the nucleus or
backbone around which the fleet is to be formed.
It has been shown that the ram, torpedo and bomb, together
with their carriers as exemplified in the torpedo boats, submarines
and aircraft, are secondary to the gun which is carried by all types
of vessels—surface, subsurface and above-surface. The gun is
still the greatest of the offensive weapons. As our tactics in a
fleet engagement are to be offensive, the vessels around which the
fleet is to be formed must be those ships which can carry the most
powerful guns. These vessels are what today are known as capital
ships. Even should they not actually take part in a fleet action in
the next war, we must judge from historical precedent that they
will be the ultimate and determining factor in obtaining and main-
taining control of the sea. Even had there been no Battle of Jut-
land, which admittedly was indecisive, the British and American
battleships at Scapa Flow and other North Sea bases, together
with the presence of a division of American battleships at Bere-
haven in Ireland, were the deciding factor in maintaing the control
of the sea for the Allies, and it was this control of the sea that de-
termined the outcome of the Great War.
To win a war power must be exerted. The gun is the most
powerful weapon of the day, and, insofar as can be seen, of the
future. The bigger the gun the more power it embodies. Only
the capital ships can carry the most powerful guns. Therefore,
this class of vessel exemplifies the essence of naval strength and
must be considered the backbone of the fleet.
The Effect of the Limitation of Armament Treaty.—Prior to
the promulgation of the Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Arma-
ments, it was practicable to determine the numbers and classes

of vessels necessary for a balanced fleet without international re-
striction. This is no longer possible. The balanced fleet for the
United States Navy no longer depends only on what naval officers
would like to have it or what tactically or strategically might seem
the best to meet the world situation from our own point of view.
It depends greatly on the restrictions injected by the treaty. This
was recognized by the general board in formulating the naval
policy which is our guide. The following significant extract taken
from the approved naval policy is quoted, owing to its importance
in determining the composition of our fleet:
U. S. Naval Policy Based on Treaty for Limitation of Naval Armament.
Preface: The Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armament, when
promulgated, will be the supreme law of the powers party to the treaty
governing their naval armaments as to capital ships and aircraft carriers.
The spirit of the treaty indicates two elements of international import :
A general desire to avoid competition in naval armament. A partial recog-
nition of a ratio in naval strengths as a means of avoiding competition.
Were any power now to undertake a program of expansion in unrestricted
classes of naval vessels or in personnel not consistent with the treaty ratios
of capital ships, a new competition in naval strengths would thereby be
initiated.
Until such time as other powers by inequitable conduct in international
relations as to U. S. interests or by their departure from the idea of a sus-
pended competition in naval armaments, indicate other procedure, the navy
of the United States may be governed in naval strengths by the spirit of
the capital ship ratios, otherwise it will be necessary appropriately to
readjust our naval policy.
To quote further from the same source, the first sentence under
the heading of General Naval Policy is :
To create, maintain and operate a navy second to none; and in con-
formity with the ratios for capital ships established by the Treaty for the
Limitation of Naval Armaments.
The Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armaments defines
capital ships as follows:
A capital ship, in the case of ships hereafter built, is defined as a vessel
of war, not an aircraft carrier, whose displacement exceeds 10,000 tons
standard displacement, or which carries a gun with a caliber exceeding eight
inches.
Under this definition there can be only two classes of capital
ships. These are the battleship and the battle cruiser. A modern
fleet which is not provided with battle cruisers operates under a
,

decided handicap. Not only are such vessels of great value tac-
tically, but they may be of inestimable value in strategic campaigns
where offensive operations in the form of attacks on the enemy
scouting forces or raids against enemy bases may have an impor-
tant bearing on deciding the success or failure of the campaign.
As an example of the value of battle cruisers for certain important
classes of operations that might occur in any war, the destruction
of Von Spee's squadron off the Falklands is cited. Battle cruisers
were the only type of vessel that could put a stop to such opera-
tions as the German squadron was carrying on. If Great Britain
had not possessed ships of this type, Von Spee would have con-
tinued to be an irritating thorn in the flanks of the Allies for an
indefinite period.
Battle cruisers may also be a factor in the ability of aircraft
carriers to operate under various conditions. The carriers them-
selves must be comparatively lightly armed. They might be
accompanied by cruisers which also are comparatively lightly
armed. The only sufficiently heavily armed vessel with adequate
speed that can be employed for accompanying and safeguarding
aircraft carriers are the battle cruisers. The United States Navy
possesses no vessels of this type. By the provisions of the treaty
we gave up such as were under construction, and accepted the
prohibition of not having any until such time as the replacement
program can begin. It is then that the decision will have to be
made as to whether the conditions warrant the new construction
to be battleships or battle cruisers, or both.
As our eighteen battleships now constitute the full treaty
strength of our capital ship allowance, it is these vessels which
form the nucleus or backbone of the fleet around which we must
assemble the auxiliary combatant vessels. This being a fact, it
needs no argument to support the assertion that the first essential
for our balanced fleet is to keep these eighteen battleships in the
finest material condition. Where improvements in offensive power
can be obtained by increasing the range of their guns, such altera-
tions should be made. The only legitimate restrictions that can
be placed on making such desirable changes as will produce this
effect are that the caliber of the guns be not increased, and that the
general type of mounting be not changed. Where improvements
in defensive strength can be obtained by equipping the ships with

additional under-water and above-water protection against tor-
pedoes and bombs, such should be immediately effected. Where
improvements can be made in steaming qualities by a change from
coal to oil fuel, they should be commenced at once.?
The Limitation of Armament Treaty, while specifying the ratio
of capital ship tonnage between Great Britain, the United States,
and Japan as 5-5-3, contemplated in spirit that this ratio should
represent the actual fighting strength in this class of vessels. Fight-
ing strength is composed of two main factors: i.e., the ability to
inflict damage and the ability to withstand damage. There is no
question but that our capital ships in toto are inferior to those of
Great Britain in fighting strength and that they are not superior to
those of Japan in the ratio of five to three. Therefore, every en- '
deavor should be made to bring about the prescribed ratio of 5-5-3
in fighting strength. There can be no legitimate grounds for claim-
ing a violation of the spirit or the letter of the treaty in so doing.
Cruisers.-On the basis of the battleships being the nucleus
around which the feet will be formed, we can now proceed with
the other fleet elements as represented by the auxiliary surface
fighting vessels, submarines and aircraft.
The Treaty for Limitation of Armaments having fixed the ratios
only for capital ships and aircraft carriers, the importance of the
auxiliary fighting craft becomes greatly enhanced. This was rec-
ognized by Great Britain as evidenced by the unwillingness of her -
statesmen to limit the tonnage in cruisers, of which ships that
nation had considerable preponderance. This has been further evi-
denced by the program for additional construction of this class of
vessel since the terms of the treaty became effective.
As our naval policy requires that the United States "create,
maintain, and operate a navy second to none,” it is necessary, in
view of the fixed ratio in capital ships, that the auxiliary fighting
ships be equal in strength to those of any other nation. Great

ful in cruisers than is the United States. That country is also in-
creasing her cruiser strength. The United States alone, of all the
naval powers, is neglecting this type of ship. Our ten modern
light cruisers, representing a total displacement of 75,000 tons,
make a pitiable showing alongside the thirty-seven British light
cruisers of 169,000 tons. We have no vessels of this type under
construction, while Great Britain has eight of 75,000 tons on the
ways, supplemented by two of 10,000 tons each, which have been
authorized by Australia. In addition Great Britain has announced
a policy embodying the construction of fifty additional light
cruisers of 10,000 tons each, five to be laid down each year for the
next ten years.
An examination of the Japanese light cruiser situation shows
that nation now possessing fifteen modern vessels of this type, of
77,000 tons total displacement. Under construction she has eight
ships with a displacement of 60,000 tons. In addition, two ships
of 10,000 tons each have been authorized. There are indications
that Japan has adopted a building program that will further in-
crease her cruiser strength.
It is seen from the foregoing that while the United States is
being "governed in naval strengths by the spirit of the capital ship
ratios," as stated in our approved naval policy, other nations are
not so considerate in respect to light cruisers. Therefore, it be-
comes "necessary appropriately to readjust our naval policy” in
this respect, if our fleet is to be equal to that of Great Britain and
superior to that of Japan in the ratio of 5 to 3.
Great Britain argues, and rightly so, that a large cruiser force
is essential to her national interests, owing to her world-wide em-
pire, her extensive and valuable trade in all parts of the world,
and for the protection of the trade routes and of her citizens
wherever they may be. These certainly are valid reasons for the
maintaining of a large number of cruisers. But have we not the
same valid reasons for having an equally large number of cruisers ?
While our trade values may not be quite as large as those of the
British Empire, they are just as wide flung, requiring the same
amount of protection along the routes. While our outlying pos-
sessions are not as widely scattered as those of Great Britain, we
have colonial interests at great distances from our home lands.
Great Britain has fortified naval bases in nearly all parts of the

world, while we have no such thing outside of the continental
limits of the United States excepting in the Canal Zone and the
Hawaiian Islands, thereby needing additional ships for the pro-
tection of bases. So, from the point of view of world-wide in-
terests, the United States needs a large number of light cruisers!
to the same extent as does Great Britain.
But the light cruiser question is one of sufficient importance to
go even further into the matter than trade values and the protec-
tion of commerce, colonies and citizens. We must look into the
value and importance of this class of vessel in a strategic campaign,
and in a naval engagement should there be another war.
The theater of operations in any war will depend on the conflict
of policy that causes the war. It is possible that the United States
may be forced into a war in which an extensive overseas campaign
is involved. In such an event naval power as embodied in the fleet
with its train must cross the ocean. The fleet must be prepared to
fight at all times. There must be scouting, and protective and de-
fensive screening. There should be vessels available for offensive
screening. Troopship and storeship convoys must be escorted. In
many respects the light cruisers are the most efficient type for
these operations. They would have to be augmented by destroyers,
submarines and aircraft, but the successful operations of all these
types will largely depend on the number of light cruisers available
to support them. While in theory there may be a definite balanced
ratio between capital ships and cruisers, in practice a fleet cannot
have too many light cruisers. The lack of sufficient vessels of this
type has been felt by the naval commanders in nearly every war.
We can repeatedly hear the echo of the frequent cry of Nelson :
"Were I to die at this moment, want of frigates would be stamped
upon my heart”; “No words of mine can express what I am suf-
fering for want of frigates”; “The last fleet was lost to me for
want of frigates”; etc., etc. It is a certainty that the commander-
in-chief of the United States fleet engaged in an overseas cam-
paign, and having only our present meager supply of light cruisers,
would suffer even more from this want than did Nelson.
Let us consider the rôle of light cruisers in a fleet engagement.
First comes the tactical scouting. The class of vessel best suited
for this work is one in which great speed is essential. Such ships
must have more gun power than do destroyers and destroyer leaders

which may be met at any time. They must be well equipped for
getting the information obtained to the coinmander-in-chief, their
immediate commander, and to certain vessels of the fleet. The light
cruiser is the only type of vessel with all these characteristics to
an efficient degree. When the battle line is formed these ships will
· take station for supporting the destroyers in attacks against capital
ships, and in preventing destroyers from gaining positions from
which to launch their torpedoes against our battle line. The great
advantage over our fleet accruing to any nation having a superior
cruiser force is apparent. In fact, the superiority which many
think would go with our fleet owing to our large number of de-
stroyers, is pure imagination. The effectiveness of a great part of
these destroyers would be nullified in an action with a fleet having
a supremacy of cruisers, as their attempts to obtain suitable attack
positions would be frustrated. If our destroyers are to be effective
we must have supporting ships for them in the shape of light
cruisers, and they should be equal in number to those of any pos-
sible adversary.
To summarize: The cruiser type of vessel, owing to speed,
steaming radius, secondary gun power, and ability for gaining in-
formation, has an immense field of operation. Independently, they
are the best commerce destroyers. Operating with the fleet in a
strategic campaign they are the most suitable vessels for distant
scouting, and for screening, both protectively and offensively.
When feets are in contact, with a battle imminent, they are the
best fitted type for tactical scouting. During an engagement they
are essential for supporting destroyer attacks and for denying
suitable attack positions to the enemy destroyers. They are ideal
escort vessels. The cruisers are, in fact, the most important
auxiliary to the capital ships. They are the fleet element which the
United States has most neglected.
The approaching superiority of our Navy in capital ship
strength was the main factor that made possible the limitation in
battleship and battle cruiser strength. Our inferiority in cruisers
prevented the acceptance of the proposal to limit this class of ves-
sel. If there is really a desire on our part to limit the cruiser
strength of the great powers, the only way we can hope to bring
it about is to adopt a cruiser building program which will balance
our feet and eventually make us superior to all other nations in
this respect.

A Balanced Fleet for the Navy
So it behooves this country immediately to initiate a cruiser
building program. This is necessary not only to balance our feet
strategically and tactically, but also to balance it with respect to
the 5-5-3 strength ratio with Great Britain and Japan which our
naval policy asserts as essential. Not less than fifty new light
cruisers are required. They should be vessels of 10,000 tons dis-
placement which is the largest permitted by the treaty. They
should have the highest practicable speed and carry as heavy a bat-
tery of eight-inch guns as possible on this displacement. Owing to
the present superiority of the British and Japanese fleets in respect
to cruisers, and owing to the announced British policy to build
fifty new cruisers, laying them down at the rate of five per year,
this country should immediately start a building program of fifty
light cruisers which should be laid down at the rate of ten per year.
In no other way can a balance in cruiser strength be obtained.?
Destroyers and Destroyer Leaders.-Although there has been a
gerferal lack of appreciation in this country of the value of the
light cruisers, no such condition has existed with respect to the
importance of destroyers. We have 267 modern first line vessels
of this class. Like the cruiser we cannot in practice have too many
destroyers. In a great war adequate employment would be found
for all in service, and there would still be need for more. In our
Navy there has been an attempt to make this class of small vessel
take the place of light cruisers. There is no question as to their
unsuitability for this. The destroyer is essentially a torpedo carry-
ing vessel, and its main rôle is for offense against the larger ships
and against submarines. In a strategic campaign they are inval-
uable for protective and defensive screening; but even here they
would be employed on the offensive-defensive in denying to sub-
narines the opportunity to get within striking distance of the fleet,
train, convoy, or whatever vessels they might at the time be escort-
ing or screening. If large numbers of destroyers are well or-
ganized, well directed, and adequately supported in a fleet action,
they will bear an important part in the outcome of the battle.
We now have sufficient destroyers to balance our fleet both stra-
tegically and tactically, and to more than balance it with respect
to the navies of Great Britain and Japan on the 5-5-3 basis. But,
? The last Congress authorized the construction of eight cruisers, but
provided funds only for the construction of two of them. This is but
slight appreciation of our need for vessels of this class.

(July

we have not the facilities or means either for properly directing
them nor for adequately supporting them. It has been pointed out
that our lack of light cruisers in the face of an enemy having a
superiority in that class of vessel, greatly nullifies the otherwise
advantage that should accrue to a greater number of destroyers.
When consideration is given to the means for directing this class
of vessel, the unsatisfactory condition of our Navy immediately
becomes apparent. We concede that for each three or four battle-
ships and for each four to eight cruisers there must be a flag officer
and adequate staff for whom suitable quarters and facilities are
available on one of the vessels. On the other hand, for a long time
we attempted to direct large units of destroyers by placing them
under the senior commanding officer who not only had to handle
his own ship, but also, perhaps, to command a squadron of eighteen
destroyers without the aid of any staff whatever. We have lately
come to recognize that destroyers cannot be efficiently directed
in this way. In consequence, there has been added to each squad-
ron an additional destroyer which carries the commander of the
squadron and a small staff. This was a move conducive to better
direction of the destroyers, but even this is not sufficient for really
efficient command in action. In the first place a destroyer having
on board its war complement is over-crowded. There are not
available adequate living quarters for a squadron commander and
his staff. Secondly, a destroyer has neither the space nor the
facilities required by a squadron commander for properly direct-
ing a large number of units. There is only one remedy for this
state of affairs. That is to build a special class of vessel known as
destroyer leaders. Great Britain and Italy have long recognized
their importance. The former now possesses fifteen and is build-
ing two more. The latter possesses six and is constructing two
additional. France has recently come to recognize their value and
is now constructing six destroyer leaders to supplement the single
one now possessed. Japan has no vessels classed as such, but it is
important to note that she has under construction nine destroyers
each of which is of a greater displacement than any of our de-
stroyers. In addition, fifteen 1,400-ton destroyers have been
authorized. 3
* Recent reports from Japan indicate that that country is contemplating
the building of a number of 3,000-ton destroyer leaders armed with guns of
5.5-inch caliber.

A Balanced Fleet for the Navy
Our fleet will never be balanced until we construct a suitable
number of destroyer leaders. Great Britain has one leader for
each twelve destroyers. With our organization of fifteen squad-
rons, each composed of eighteen destroyers, there should be fif-
teen leaders, one for each squadron. These destroyer leaders
being for the purpose of leading and directing destroyers in action
niust be primarily torpedo carrying craft. An efficient battery of
guns is essential; but torpedoes must not be sacrificed for the gun.
Destroyer leaders in performing their function in battle must of
necessity encounter light cruisers. It is not expected or intended
that they can defeat light cruisers. But, under the conditions of
encounter, the cruisers will probably be engaged with a large num-
ber of destroyers the guns of which are not of sufficient caliber to
materially damage the cruiser. The destroyer leaders, therefore,
should carry a gun, the projectiles of which on hitting a cruiser
will inflict sufficient damage to make them worth while. As the
6-inch gun is the smallest one which possesses this qualification
our destroyer leaders should be designed to carry guns of this
caliber.
Our fifteen destroyer leaders, then, should be vessels of between
2,500 and 3,000 tons displacement. They must have not less than
twenty-five knots speed and a long steaming radius. They should
carry a battery of four triple torpedo tubes, at least two of which
should be on the midship line; three 6-inch 50-caliber guns all on
the midship line; anti-aircraft gun, and offensive means against
submarines. Above all, they must possess the capacity and facili-
ties that permit of a commander and adequate staff for properly
directing a squadron of eighteen destroyers.
We now have sufficient destroyers to balance our feet in this
respect from both the strategical and tactical standpoint. We are
ahead of the 5-5-3 ratio in destroyer strength. Many, however,
are deteriorating, owing to lack of personnel to care for them. All
of our first line destroyers are of the same vintage. In conse-
quence all will become obsolete at the same time. Therefore, our
chief concern with the destroyers is in keeping fit the large number
which are out of commission, in preparing a suitable replacement
plan, and in providing for them a number of leaders so as to insure
their being efficiently directed.

Submarines. The conferences which preceded the final drafts
of the Treaty Limiting Naval Armaments and of the Treaty Re-
lating to the Use of Submarines and Noxious Gases in Warfare,
clearly indicated that the representatives of the foreign nations
concerned did not adopt the purely idealistic attitude of our own
statesmen, but were, to a great extent, influenced by the advan-
tages or disadvantages which would accrue to their own country
by the adoption of each of the proposals. As an example of this
we see the British representatives pleading for the outlawry of
the submarine in any form, and the French representatives main-
taining the necessity of continuing this type of vessel as a weapon
of warfare. The outcome was the second five power treaty, the
terms of which outlaw the submarine as a commerce destroyer.
This treaty does not become effective until ratified by all the sig-
natory powers, and as France has not ratified it, its provisions are
not in effect as international law.
Whether or not the submarine treaty is finally ratified, it affects
only the use of subsurface vessels as commerce destroyers and has
no bearing whatever on their use in warfare against combatant
ships. Submarines have not been employed as yet in a fleet' en-
gagement. However, with their rapid development in size, power,
maneuverability, and means of communicating, there is the prob-
ability that they will hold an important place in the battle lines of
the future.
In a strategic campaign the field of operations of submarines is
large. With the advent of aircraft as parts of fleets the submarine
gains value as a scouting and screening vessel. It is the ideal type
of ship for reconnaissance. Any fleet engaged in an overseas cam-
paign needs submarines of sufficient speed and adequate habit-
ability as auxiliaries for screening. Not only is the submarine a
good vessel for protective screening: i.e., to give warning of the
approach of an enemy, but conditions can be visualized where they
might be of great value in offensive operations against the enemy's
information service. In order to balance our fleet for such opera-
tions that might be required in another war submarines are an
essential. In future international conferences held for the purpose
of further limiting naval armaments, should an attempt be made
to outlaw the submarine as a combatant ship, it is hoped that our
idealistic tendencies will not govern to the extent of agreeing to

A Balanced Fleet for the Navy
such a step. The abolishment of the submarine would have a de-
cidedly weakening effect in the ability of our fleet to carry out a
prolonged campaign.
Great Britain is the only navy which has what are known as
monitor submarines. These are few in number and have only very
limited capabilities. It is doubtful if additional vessels of this type
will be constructed as hereafter they must be included in the capital
ship tonnage owing to their carrying a gun of a caliber greater
than eight inches. Both Japan and the United States exceed Great
Britain in effective first line submarines, their numbers being :
Japan, thirty-three; United States, forty-four; Great Britain,
twenty-six. But of the larger type, classified as feet submarines,
Great Britain possesses eight, to five for Japan and three for the
United States.
Under construction Great Britain has only two first-line sub-
marines and one fleet submarine; Japan has three first-line, four
second-line, and twenty-two fleet submarines; the United States
has six first-line, and three fleet submarines with an additional
six of this latter class authorized, but construction held in abey-
ance. Thus, when the present authorized building programs are
completed, Japan and the United States will be about on a parity
in the total of modern first-line submarines, while Great Britain
will be considerably weaker.
With our battleships not maintained in condition to insure a
fighting strength superior to that of Japan in the ratio of five to
three; with Japan having a cruiser force of greater strength than
ours; with the advantage of our large number of destroyers greatly
nullified by reason of our weakness in cruisers, and not having any
destroyer leaders; it is essential if we are to maintain a fleet ratio
of five to three with respect to Japan, that our submarines be su-
perior to those of Japan in that ratio. Japan has a total of sixty-
six modern effective submarines built and building. In order to
balance our fleet it is necessary that we have a total of not less than
110, which number is forty-five more than our present effectives,
built, building and authorized. These new submarines should be
of two types. At least half of them should be of sufficiently high
surface speed to enable them to accompany the fleet in battle and
have a steaming radius, at moderate fleet speed, as great as that
of our destroyers. The remainder should be of moderate surface

speed, fairly high submerged speed and have sufficient fuel capacity
to be self sustaining for a period of from six weeks to two months.
Aircraft and Aircraft Carriers.—The accepted inference that
aircraft are to form an integral part of a modern fleet is not based
on actual performances in the past. During the Great War the
operation of flying machines in conjunction with the fleets was
very limited. They took no part in the Battle of Jutland. The
plans of Admiral Scheer contemplated the employment of Zep-
pelins for scouting prior to the sortie of the German High Seas
Fleet. This sortie was not made with a fleet action in view but was
for the purpose of covering certain raiding operations on the Eng-
lish coast, fathered by the hope that a detachment of the British
fleet would be trapped. But weather conditions prevented the use of
the Zeppelins, and in consequence Scheer had to change his plans.
Heavier-than-air craft were used independently of the fleets
chiefly as patrols, and as escorts of convoys as protective measures
against submarines. The development of flying machines has gone
forward with such rapid strides, their future employment in much
wider spheres than were undertaken during the Great War has
become apparent. The possible uses of air craft extend into the
field of scouting, screening, patrolling, escorting, bombing and
spotting. In each one of these classes of operations they will be
involved with surface ships. Heavier-than-air flying machines
have not yet acquired the capacity of operating at great distances
from land without the necessity of having surface craft bases.
Lighter-than-air ships have had their possible effectiveness greatly
increased by the replacement of hydrogen by helium. They are
capable of operating at great distances over the sea without the aid
of surface craft. So, in determining as to what aircraft are re-
quired for our fleet, it is necessary to consider the heavier-than-air
machines in connection with the surface vessels on which they
will be carried, or by which they will be tended, while the lighter-
than-air ships can be decided on independently of surface vessels.
We have come to recognize that airplanes should be carried on
as many of the combatant surface ships of the fleet as can be done
without otherwise lessening their offensive characteristics. The
number of such planes is, therefore, determined by the number of
these ships that can carry them, but the fleet requires many more
planes than can be carried on board the regular combatant ships.

A Balanced Fleet for the Navy
This is recognized by all nations. Its importance was made evi-
dent by the provisions of the Limitation of Armament Treaty
which placed the ratio of airplane carriers allowed to the United
States, Great Britain, and Japan on exactly the same basis as the
capital ships. The treaty defines an aircraft carrier as:
A vessel of war with a displacement in excess of 10,000 tons standard
displacement designed for the specific and exclusive purpose of carrying
aircraft. It must be so constructed that aircraft can be launched therefrom
and landed thereon, and not designed and constructed for carrying a more
powerful armament than that allowed to it under Article IX or Article X
as the case may be.
The articles referred to limit the caliber of gun that may be car-
ried on aircraft carriers to eight inches. In the case of the two
carriers permitted with a displacement greater than 27,000 tons,
only eight 8-inch guns may be carried. All other carriers may
carry ten of these guns.
The total aircraft carrier displacement authorized for the three
nations which are concerned in the 5-5-3 ratio are 135,000 tons
each for the United States and Great Britain, and 81,000 tons for
Japan. This permits of the two former each having five carriers
of 27,000 each, and Japan having three carriers of this displace-
ment. The fleets of the three nations can profitably employ all the
aircraft that can be attained. Their respective navies will even-
tually be governed in this respect by the limitations placed on the
carriers by the treaty. It is apparent that the United States fleet,
in order to be made as effective as possible should maintain the full
aircraft carrier strength permitted by the treaty. For a proper
balance it should, at all times, he equal in this respect to Great
Britain, and superior to Japan in the ratio of five to three.
There is in existence only one completed aircraft carrier, classed
as of the first line. This belongs to Great Britain. Of experi-
mental or second line ships, which, in accordance with the terms
of the treaty may be replaced, the United States and Japan each
have one, while Great Britain has two. The building programs of
the three nations show that Great Britain has three under con-
struction with a total displacement of 56,300 tons; the United
States, two, with a displacement of 66,000 tons and Japan two,
with a displacement of 53,900 tons. It is thus seen that in this
important fleet element the United States is not keeping pace with

U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
Great Britain, nor are we ahead of Japan in the ratio of five to
three.
The indications are that the control of the air will be an im-
portant factor in any future naval battle or overseas campaign.
Therefore, in order to balance our fleet so as to give it at least an
equal chance in this respect, there should immediately be a pro-
gram which will provide for the full 135,000 tons of aircraft car-
riers as provided for in the treaty.
In regard to the growing importance of aircraft, certain features
as laid down in the treaty while not at present appearing impor-
tant, may become so at a future date. One of these is the specifica-
tion that a vessel is not classed as an airplane carrier unless of a
displacement greater than 10,000 tons. It is within the realm of
possibility that some nation or nations may attach sufficient im-
portance to the air to start a building program of vessels to be used
exclusively for carrying aircraft with displacements less than
10,000 tons. Such ships, in accordance with the letter of the
treaty, would not be aircraft carriers and need not be included in
the limit of displacement authorized for such vessels. Whether or
not their construction violates the spirit of the treaty would un-
doubtedly depend on which nation started the construction.
Another feature is the treaty definition of an aircraft carrier
which states that the vessel must be designed for, “the specific and
exclusive purpose of carrying aircraft.” It is well within the realm
of probability that some nation or nations will design vessels with
the specific purpose of carrying aircraft, but not with the exclusive
purpose. If these vessels should have guns of greater caliber than
eight inches, or if they should displace more than 10,000 tons they
would be classified as capital ships and would have to be included
in the authorized capital ship ratio.*
* Since writing the above announcement has been made to the effect that
the two new British capital ships which are to be called the Rodney and
Nelson will embody the features of the present day capital ship and of air-
plane carriers. They are to have a battery of 16-inch guns all placed forward
of the foremast, and there will be a flying on deck abaft the smoke-stacks.
These vessels cannot have a displacement greater than 35,000 tons to con-
form with treaty requirements. They must be classed as capital ships as
they carry 16-inch guns. They are not aircraft carriers within the treaty
classification because of the large guns, and because they are not for the
"exclusive” purpose of carrying aircraft. There must be a sacrifice in some

A Balanced Fleet for the Navy
While these two special cases do not influence our balanced fleet
of today, there is the possibility that they may influence it as soon
as our first replacement program or the replacement program of
some other nation begins. It therefore seems fitting that they
should be given some thought at this time.
There is nothing in the Treaty for the Limitation of Naval
Armaments for preventing a nation from building as many lighter-
than-air ships as may be desired. In this country the value of
such vessels becomes certain by the advent of helium. The infor-
mation service of the fleet, especially in view of our weakness in
light cruisers would be greatly enhanced by a number of airships.
The recent successful long distance flights of the Shenandoah and
the Los Angeles are impressive as being indicative of the future
value of this class of ship in naval campaigns. The fleet should be
augmented by at least five additional lighter-than-air ships, which
should operate with the fleet as a part of such. Whether or not
further additional airships should be built must depend on the re-
sults obtained in these operations.
Non-combatant Vessels.—The necessity of a fleet train is ap-
parent. No fleet can carry out a successful campaign without
certain noncombatant auxiliaries that are necessary for its logistic
requirements. There must be ships for carrying fuel, water, am-
munition, food and supplies of all sorts. There must be tenders
for the care of destroyers, submarines and heavier-than-air craft.
There must be repair ships and hospital ships. In addition there
are required certain smaller vessels which might in a way be classi-
fied as combatant ships, such as mine sweepers, mine layers, patrol
vessels and tugs. As pointed out at the beginning of this paper
only the character and the number of the combatant ships that
should compose our fleet would be examined into. Therefore, the
numbers of all these different types of train vessels which are
necessary for a fleet, will not be determined here. Suffice it to say
that their numbers depend on the composition and size of the com-
batant fleet.
military quality, which, it is ventured to suggest will be in the weight of
side armor. The unusual design of these ships leads to the supposition that
they may be intended for use as fleet flagships, and that the hybrid char-
acter which they feature may be intended only for these two vessels, and
may not be included in future designs.

U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings
Conclusion.—The balanced feet for the United States Navy
requires :
I. Eighteen battleships, all maintained in the highest state of
efficiency. This necessitates in the cases of some of them: (a)
An increase in the elevation of guns. (b) A change from coal fuel
to oil fuel. (c) Increased protection against torpedoes and bombs.
2. Sixty modern light cruisers. In order that our strength in
this respect may equal that of Great Britain and be superior to that
of Japan in the ratio of five to three, there should be authorized a
building program of fifty new vessels, ten of which should be laid
down each year for the next five years.
3. Two hundred seventy destroyers (our present number).
As all of these vessels are the same age, and, in consequence, be-
come obsolete at practically the same time, a replacement program
should be immediately initiated.
4. Fifteen destroyer leaders. There are no vessels of this type
in the fleet. All of them should be provided for at once.
5. One hundred ten modern effective submarines. In order to
obtain this number a building program of forty-five new vessels is
necessary. All new submarines should be capable of operating as
a part of and with the fleet.
6. Five first-line airplane carriers. There are two under con-
struction. Three additional should be laid down as soon as prac-
ticable.
7. Six lighter-than-air ships. As the Los Angeles is only, for
commercial purposes, provision should be made to augment the
Shenandoah by five new dirigibles.
8. Sufficient train vessels to insure the efficient operation of the
combatant fleet.
This country prides itself on the justice of its proclaimed poli-
cies. We still recognize that a reasonable amount of armament is es-
sential. This armament can best be incorporated in a balanced fleet.
"A just man armed keepeth his house in order."
